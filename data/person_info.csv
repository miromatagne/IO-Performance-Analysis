2,4147861,19,"Richard Matthew Clark was born and raised in southeastern, NC, in a small town called, Chadbourn, NC.  He has a tragic tale filled with emotion that becomes one with the canvas he paints. Clark has a way through any media to lead you into a world that traps your soul.  His mother left him at six months old and his dad that's drinking almost destroyed the both of them.  His mother came back into his life when he was twelve only to attempt to murder him.  Art was his only outlet to express his emotion. His senior year in High School he excelled in the arts and was offered a full scholarship to the Parsons School of Art and the Art Institute, as well as, an internship with Marvel and Disney.  The light at the end of the tunnel was soon dimmed as he had to put his dad in a rehab clinic and drop out of school to save their home.  He saved their home but soon after his father was released from rehab his dad furious of being admitted into the treatment center, gave the home up any way and the two went their separate ways.  With no one to seek shelter with Clark found himself sleeping in a cemetery on a cement tomb staring at the sky seeking a way out.  He went to a local community college during the day where he obtained his adult high school diploma and joined the United States Army.  He found himself joining the military where he fought in the Infantry and forever tried to find a way back to the path to use his art. He is the type of person that has faced trial after trial but no matter how many times he has been knocked to the ground he has always managed to summon the strength to stand back up and face whatever the powers that be had to throw at him.  Trying to have a real family for once he married at 18 and had 2 sons by 21. His wife turned out to be just like his mom and ended up walking out on the family and never looking back.  He was a single father and left the military where he would sell sketches and paint murals for income.  3 years past and he built a sign and graphics company and then married a female that tried to take what he had worked so hard to build. They had one child together and during the divorce proceeding the wife told the judge \"Sir he can have the child I just want the money!\" Clark threw the keys to her from across the court room and kept his 3 sons together.  He lost everything again but then kept the thing that mattered most....his children.  With just an airbrush left he went to the beaches of the Carolina's and started painting t-shirts for money. This fine artist that seemed to channel the spirits of the masters had been reduced to doing whatever it took art wise to eat.  He found himself working night and day to provide for everyone and with the street smarts he possessed he managed to turn money over and open an airbrush shop in the mall. Three years past and he met a bi racial girl that was born and raised in Germany. They dated for a while and she seemed to be the only one that could tame the battle tossed artist.  They were married in 2005 and now Clark finally has his family and now with four sons.  Although, Clark, has been through so much he always remains positive and humble and true to his southern charm. His work is able to captivate people from all walks of life and crosses over to all races, religions and backgrounds. His art is now world wide and his clients include everyone from the Ruff Ryderz, Warren Sapp and the Hollywood Elite.  Mr. Clark does everything from acting, producing, writing screenplays, set painting, special effects make up, music; and even owns custom body shops and mall stores, as well as, his own Production Company.  Born and raised in the Carolina's of the United States he is a hardened and battle tossed soul that still displays the characteristics of a leader. One that does not drink or use drugs; he stands as a knight making sure others do not have to struggle and feel the pain that he has known.","Tesha Dockery \"germanpheonix@yahoo.com\""

He was an early supporter of singer Bobby Darin, inspired and then 'broke' his hit single, 'Splish-Splash', and made a guest appearance on his \"This is Your Life\" TV tribute in late 1959.  In 1964, he was one of the first Americans to interview The Beatles, firstly by phone, later joining them in their hotel suite. From then on he acted as their \"Mr. Fix-it\", arranging for them to visit all the best clubs and restaurants. He also championed their records and for a while, he dubbed himself \"the fifth Beatle\" and became a trusted friend of the group during their American tours, though not of manager Brian Epstein, who apparently resented his considerable influence.

The band members were: Aimee Mann (vocals/bass), Robert Holmes (vocals/guitar), Joey Pesce (keyboards), and Michael Hausman (drums). Their music was distinguished by Mann's beautiful vocals, exceptionally literate lyrics, thoughtful and mature subject matter, and rich, lovely melodies. 'Til Tuesday started out playing around the Boston area and won Boston's WBCN Rock & Roll Rumble battle of the bands contest in 1983. They subsequently signed with the label Epic Records and released their debut album \"Voices Carry\" in 1985. The haunting and poignant titular tune was a substantial hit single; it peaked at #8 on the Billboard pop radio charts. The album also sold well; it reached #19 on the Top 20 album charts. Moreover, the music video for \"Voices Carry\" won the MTV Video Music Award for Best New Artist. Alas, the band's follow-up 1986 album \"Welcome Home\" was less successful; it barely cracked the Top 50 at #49 on the Billboard album charts. The moving song \"What About Love\" did a little better; it went all the way to #26 on the Billboard pop radio charts. Although their third and final album \"Everything's Different Now\" received positive notices from music critics in 1988, it nonetheless was a complete commercial flop. 'Til Tuesday broke up in 1988. Aimee Mann has since gone on to have a hugely successful solo career while Michael Hausman serves as Mann's manager.",woodyanders

From MTV to BET to ABC to Source All Access (Nationally Syndicated) to Interscope Presents the Next Episode (on Showtime), the multi-talented producer has paid his dues and the payoff is set for the year 2004. Born Todd Brown, the Brooklyn native showed early promise during his school years and definitely stood out amongst the crowd. He lists early rap stars KRS-One and LL Cool J as major musical influences and by age 16, he had begun to rap professionally. But although he desired a music career, Todd went off to college.  While studying Cable and Corporate Communications, Todd got his first taste of Television production. He took everything from `Speech' to `Remote TV Production' to `Physics of Music'. One day a fellow student came into class wearing a suit and told him about an internship interview that he was going to. He gave him the phone number and his call led to an internship with a growing company called MTV.  Rising from intern to production assistant to associate producer, Todd knew that he found his niche. He quickly bonded with Ted Demme, who took him on as his apprentice. During this time, the music world was revving its engines and the rise of prominent hip-hop and R&B groups were beginning to take over the charts. The show, MTV's 'Fade to Black' (which would later spawn the hit show 'MTV Jams') achieved strong ratings with Todd himself as the offbeat host, proved to be a real learning experience. Having worked with such premiere artists as Babyface, Janet Jackson, Shaquille O'Neal, TLC and Queen Latifah, it was a short time before he received the call to work at BET. Although he spent less than two years there, BET proved to be another stepping stone for the passionate Todd-1.  After a brief stint setting up the foundation for a Mike Tyson record label, Todd hooked up with friend and NBA star Derrick Coleman to form 44 Ways entertainment. Described it as a `full-service entertainment conglomerate which will catered to Music, Television and Film' Todd-1 had his plate full running the day to day operations. 2 years later, Todd returned to his roots as a Producer of Hip Hop Television shows taking on the post of Supervising Producer at the nationally syndicated show - \"Source All Access\". It was during the hiatus of this show that he wrote his first screenplay entitled \"Money Boys\".  Currently Todd is the Producer of \"Interscope Presents The Next Episode\", airing on Showtime Networks. This is the first of its kind, Hip Hip docu-drama delving into the lives of future rap stars. Todd has relocated to Los Angeles and is looking forward to the upcoming challenges that await.",Todd 1

They contributed the songs \"Not from Her World\" and \"Baby Go Bye Bye\" to the soundtrack of the spooky and offbeat supernatural shocker \"The Boogeyman.\" Moreover, 4 Out of 5 Doctors appear as themselves and perform the songs \"Mr. Cool Shoes,\" \"Modern Man,\" \"Waiting for a Change,\" \"Dawn Patrol,\" and \"Waiting for Roxanne\" at a party in the superior slasher horror cult favorite \"The House on Sorority Row.\" The group scored 82 in the \"Rate-a-Record\" segment on Dick Clark's \"American Bandstand.\" The band released their sophomore album \"Second Opinion\" in 1982. When that album proved to be an undeserved commercial flop, they subsequently broke up in 1984. On July 20, 2008 4 Out of 5 Doctors reunited for a well-received sold-out show at the Jammin' Jive club in Vienna, Virginia. The group also performed at the 2008 Wammie Awards at the State Theatre in Falls Church, Virginia on February 15, 2009.

240,300,19,"Cali rapper 40 Glocc is living the dream. He is signed to a deal with lifetime friends Mobb Deep - with whom he is about to embark on a national tour - on Infamous/G-Unit Records. He's recording his first album under that deal with some of the top producers in the business (Dr Dre, Alchemist, Havoc) and is traveling to places in the world he once only dreamed of seeing. It would seem that he has everything right now that an aspiring artist could ever want, and that is certainly true; but it certainly wasn't always that way. This is definitely no overnight success story.  Born as Tory Gasaway in Galveston, Texas, 40 Glocc didn't know his mother until the age of 8. Instead, he was raised by his grandparents in Beaumont, along with 14 other children. His father was never around much either. During those eight years, 40 only knew his mother, and a younger sister he had never met, by the pictures his grandparents showed him. He only knew that they lived in California and that one day, his mother was coming to get him. His grandmother told him so.  She did in fact come to get him and moved him to the MacArthur Park area of Downtown Los Angeles. 40 was so glad to see her and his sister, and he just knew that life was going to get better now that his family was reunited. After a time the family relocated to Colton City, San Bernadino, to an area also known as \"The Zoo\" and the problems at home began. 40 and his mother didn't get along at all. He didn't feel that she cared at all about what happened to him. His new friends did though and 40 started spending all of his time with them. His friends, unfortunately, were all members of the Colton City Crips. The deeper 40 got into that lifestyle, and its ensuing traps, the worse things became at home. Finally, at the age of 13, 40 left home for good, choosing instead to sleep in the cars of friends, or outside of grocery stores with the bums. It was a life he became adept at dealing with. His role models and father figures, such as they were, were gang bangers and drug dealers and 40 learned to survive through them and live by their street code, reaping all the rewards such a life inevitably has in store. Among other things, 40 was shot several times, ending up in a wheelchair for many months after one such incident during which he was shot by police. He finally caught a case from a home invasion charge he didn't commit. A charge it took him six months to beat.  Through all of this though, 40 did have a dream. He also had a talent, that of rapping, and of telling vivid stories of the things he had been through and of his life on the streets. Narratives that people could relate to. People like him. Word didn't take long to reach the right ears; the streets are like that. By '97 group The Zoo Crew (40 Glocc, K-9 and Natural Born) had formed and were dropping their first album \"Migrate, Adapt or Die\" produced by Tony and Julio G. The album became an underground hit and 40 was recognized as one of the best hidden talents in the streets. Soon he was an integral part of the scene and recording with his West Coast peers. It was his manager and long-time friend Storm though that negotiated his first solo deal with Empire Music Werks who were distributed by BMG. It was through this deal that 40 Glocc released his first solo effort, \"The Jackal\" which featured a who's who list of West Coast talent - Ras Kass, Bad Azz, Kurupt, Spice 1 and Tray Dee - and production from the best Cali had to offer; long-time supporter Dr Dre, Battle Cat and Protégé. Empire didn't have their promotion game up to snuff though and after sinking much of what he had been advanced back into promoting the album himself, 40 decided to go his own way.  At this time, manager Storm's other act, Mobb Deep had been making a lot of noise since their debut \"Infamous\" on Jive and it was only natural that they would take an interest in the career of their friend. First instincts said get 40 a deal at Jive but conversations went nowhere and Storm began to shop 40 Glocc at the other majors. Unfortunately, the West Coast had lost their hold on the rap game and no one wanted to take a chance that a West Coast artist could sell. It was a set-back, as was Jive's dropping of Mobb Deep but as life often so does, things took a sudden turn for the great. Mobb Deep was signed to G-Unit and suddenly they and their friend 40 Glocc were running around with rap's finest. This was a home 40 could live with and it wasn't long before that became a reality; he signed to Mobb Deep's imprint Infamous under G-Unit. Some things have remained the same however. 40 is still recording with Dr Dre and he is still writing stories that people his can relate to. That is his goal. To give hope with his lyrics to people who are coming up through some of what he has already lived to tell. To let them know that they too can achieve their dream. To believe in themselves when there is no one else to believe in you.  40 Glocc is pursuing acting as well. He recently wrapped a supporting role in a feature film entitled \"Playboys\" from directors Zach Cregger and Trevor Moore (\"The Whitest Kids U Know\"). He's also featured in a new AFI (American Film Institute) short film called \"The Second Half\". Being a part of a prestigious AFI Film was a great experience for him. 40 Glocc has also appeared in other feature films such as \"Thicker Than Blood\", \"Book Of Love\" and Snoop Dogg's \"Tha Eastsidaz\".  With what he has already accomplished, what are some of 40 Glocc's other dreams? To make an album that touches peoples' souls. He feels that what he is recording now is his best work ever. He knows he can't rap forever though. He also hopes to make his label Zoo Life something he can grow old with. After all, right now, just the thought that he has made it to a point in his life where he probably will live to grow old is a major blessing.",Keith Louis Brown

363,339,19,"Born in the South Jamaica section of Queens, Curtis \"50 Cent\" Jackson has lived in New York City all his life. Raised by his grandparents after his father ran out and his mother was shot when he was only eight. Growing up, the Queens rapper originally wanted to be a heavyweight boxer, but eventually fell back on rapping. DJs had taken it upon themselves to release two Best of 50 Cent mix CDs, before he had even signed to a major label. 50 Cent hit the scene with \"How To Rob\" and he's been on a rampage ever since dealing with bootleggers, label back stabbing and other platinum selling artists trying to get at him physically. In 1999 his album Power of the Dollar, was heavily bootlegged and Trackmasters/Columbia never released it. Supposedly, Trackmasters weren't comfortable with him being caught up in the streets and getting shot three days before filming the video for \"Thug Love,\" (with Destiny's Child) -- his first single. 50 was shot three times that night, two shots hitting him in the head, the bullet that struck his face he carries as a reminder of what happened. That event led to the fall out with Columbia and negotiating his release from their grasps. He still showed love and rhymed over a Trackmasters produced remix of \"I'm Gonna Be Alright\" on J-Lo's latest album, but rivals at Murder Inc. had 50 cut from the track which could have launched the rapper. This all changed in one night when Eminem said on a radio show that \"50 Cent is definitely my favorite rapper right now, he's the only one keeping it real.\" The very next day a bidding war started on 50, ending when 50 signed to Eminem's very own label Shady/Aftermath. 50 Cent's fame has exploded, being produced by Dr. Dre and Eminem and finally making his debut album \"Get rich or Die Tryin'.\" 50 has full access and advantage of the streets through mix-tapes; that's his forum because he controls it. 50 Cent is the most anticipated artist of 2003. It's well deserved because he's \"been patiently waiting.\"",Rod Reece

The line-up was: 'Janice Marie Johnson' (qv) (guitar/bass/vocals), 'Hazel Payne' (qv) (guitar/vocals), Perry Kibble (keyboards) and Donald Ray Johnson (drums). A Taste of Honey started out playing at various clubs in Southern California and at American military bases in both the United States and abroad (the band did USO tours in such places as Spain, Alaska, Thailand, Morocco and Japan). The group were discovered by Capitol Records in 1976 and signed up with the label two years later. They scored a massive smash in 1978 with the infectiously funky disco song \"Boogie Oogie Oogie\", which peaked at #1 on the Billboard pop charts for three consecutive weeks, sold over two million copies, and earned the group a Grammy Award for Best New Artist on February 15, 1979. The follow-up song, \"Do It Good\", was a #13 hit on the R&B radio charts. By 1980, the band had become a duo consisting of only 'Janice Marie Johnson' (qv) and 'Hazel Payne' (qv). In 1981, A Taste of Honey had another huge success with their cover of the lovely Japanese ballad \"Sukiyaki\", which soared to #1 on the R&B radio charts and climbed all the way to #3 on the Billboard pop charts. The band broke up in the early 80s. 'Janice Marie Johnson' (qv) went on to pursue a solo career, 'Hazel Payne' (qv) became an international stage actress, Donald Ray Johnson has recorded several blues albums and continues to play the drums (he's also a well-known blues singer/drummer in Western Canada), and Perry Kibble sadly died of heart failure at the tragically young age of 49 in 1999.

He was born on September 25, 1943, in Los Angeles, where his mother owned a dance studio. On TV almost from infancy, he started appearing in unbilled film bits at the age of eight in such classics as _The Greatest Show on Earth (1952)_ (qv) and _High Noon (1952)_ (qv). He quickly moved to featured status before year's end. He showed promise as the kidnapped Indian \"Red Chief\" in a segment of the film _Full House (1952)_ (qv) and another kidnap victim as the son of scientist 'Gene Barry' (qv) in _Atomic City (1952)_. From there he co-starred in the 'John Wayne (I)' (qv) western classic _Hondo (1953)_ (qv) as the inquisitive blond son of homesteader 'Geraldine Page' (qv), and appeared to good advantage in other movies such as the film noir thriller _Jeopardy (1953)_ (qv) with 'Barbara Stanwyck' (qv), the hoss opera drama _Arena (1953)_ (qv) with 'Gig Young' (qv) and the comedies _Mister Scoutmaster (1953)_ (qv) with 'Clifton Webb' (qv) and _Ricochet Romance (1954)_ (qv) with 'Marjorie Main' (qv).  Stardom, however, was assured after nabbing the role of the famous dog's young master on the \"Rin Tin Tin\" series. After the show's demise, however, Aaker did not survive the transition into adult roles. He instead moved into the production end of the business, serving as an assistant to producer 'Herbert B. Leonard' (qv) on the _\"Route 66\" (1960)_ (qv) series, then later dropped out altogether to become a carpenter. He still attends nostalgia conventions and was recently a \"Kids of the West\" honoree at the 2005 Golden Boot Awards.",Gary Brumburgh / gr-home@pacbell.net

She's mainly known for her career as a singer - and for her fantastic stage-performance - which is a mix of her songs and stand-up comedy between the songs. She studied at Aalborghus Gymnasium, but dropped out to - as she says - study life instead.  She released her first album \"Lille filantrop\" (\"Little philanthropist\") in 2008, and her second album \"Missinær\" (\"Missionary\") in 2010 on Playground Records. Both produced by Henrik Marstal. Both albums were very well received by Danish reviewers. Five and six stars pretty much all over, but none of the albums gave her a massive radio-hit. \"Tyk\" (\"Fat\") from the first album gave her enough attention to fill the small concert-halls, and the title-track from \"Missionær\" was a regular on the national Danish radio a few months after release. A third album will be released in 2012.  In 2009 she won the acclaimed award \"Steppeulven\" as best, upcoming act.  Annika was cast for the world's first theatre-musical \"Come Together\", entirely based on The Beatles songs. Also here she gained great success, and were referred to as a \"main attraction\" in the show in a TV review. Her acting-career includes various small parts, until landing the role as Daimi in the 2011 film about the Danish comedian and actor Dirch Passer.",Jacob Nielsen

784,1739753,19,"Talented. Beautiful. Modest. These three words described R&B singer-turned-actress Aaliyah perfectly. Born in Brooklyn, New York but raised in Detroit, Aaliyah got her first major exposure appearing on the syndicated television series _\"Star Search\" (1983)_ (qv) where she awed the audience with her amazing voice and talent. Withdrawing from the celebrity scene for a few years, Aaliyah lived the life of a normal teenage girl, attending Detroit's Performing Arts High School where she majored in dance. It was around this same time that Aaliyah met singer/composer 'R. Kelly' (qv). Kelly assisted Aaliyah with the production of her debut album \"Age Ain't Nothing But A number\" which scored several number hits, specifically \"Back and Forth.\" The album's title was a brief reference to her short-lived marriage to 'R. Kelly' (qv) (she was 15 years of age at the time, and he was in his 20s). Thir marriage was annulled due to her status as a minor. During her senior year, Aaliyah went on to record \"One In A Million\" which featured the songwriting talents of major R&B producers/writers 'Missy 'Misdemeanor' Elliott' (qv) and 'Tim Mosley (I)' (qv). That album was a major success and sealed Aaliyah's fame forever. After seeing her at an awards show and in the video for her hit song \"Are You that Somebody?\" (from the 'Eddie Murphy (I)' (qv) film _Doctor Dolittle (1998)_ (qv)), film producer 'Joel Silver (I)' (qv) (producer of _The Matrix (1999)_ (qv) and other major actor films) asked Aaliyah to audition for a role in an upcoming romance/action film called _Romeo Must Die (2000)_ (qv). With her determination and sex appeal, Aaliyah won Silver over and was cast in her first major film role. _Romeo Must Die (2000)_ (qv) was a hit at the box office. This film led to her being cast as one of the stars of the film based on 'Anne Rice (I)' (qv)'s _Queen of the Damned (2002)_ (qv) and in the two sequels to the major box office hit, _The Matrix (1999)_ (qv). During the busy schedule of her film career, Aaliyah took time to record her third album, the self-titled \"Aaliyah\". July 2001 was a busy time for Aaliyah. After the sucess of her song \"Try Again\" for which she was nominated for a Grammy Award and won several MTV Video Awards, Aaliyah finally released her \"Aaliyah\" album. Debuting at number two on the Billboard charts, \"Aaliyah\" was a sales success despite many lack-lustre reviews it received. In August 2001, Aaliyah took time off from her busy album promotional tour to fly to the Bahamas to film a video for the song \"Rock the Boat\". The video, filmed on Abaco Island, was directed by 'Hype Williams' (qv), a major music video director known for his style and wit. On August 25, 2001, after filming the video, Aaliyah and about 9-11 of her entourage took off from Marsh Harbour airport at 6:50pm EDT in a small Cessna 404 en route to Opa-Locka, Florida. A few minutes after take-off, the plane crashed about 200 feet from the runaway killing Aaliyah and many others instantly. Four passnegers were pulled alive from the wreckage, and one later died at a hospital in Nassau. Aaliyah was only 22 years old. Aaliyah's short-lived, but brillant career was a true success story for a young African-American woman who went against all odds to be herself in an industry where originality is scarce. Truly missed by her family, friends, and fans, her music and film contributions will live forever.",Luis32789@aol.com
785,1739753,19,"On January 16th 1979 the world was blessed with the birth of Aaliyah Dana Haughton in Brooklyn, New York. Aaliyah was raised by her father, mother and brother 'Rashad Haughton' (qv) in Detroit. At age 9 she appeared on _\"Star Search\" (1983)_ (qv), the TV program and sang \"My Funny Valentine\", a song which her mother had sung years earlier. At age 11, she sang with 'Gladys Knight' (qv) in a five-night stint in Las Vegas. In 1992, she began to work on her debut album with the help of singer 'R. Kelly' (qv). The album, \"Age Ain't Nothing But A Number\" was released in 1994 and received heavy praise. Aaliyah came under attack shortly after when reports suggested she was married to 'R. Kelly' (qv). At the time, she was 15, he was 27. The marriage was apparently annulled. In 1995, she began to work on her 2nd album, alongside 'Jermaine Dupri' (qv), 'Tim Mosley (I)' (qv), 'Slick Rick (I)' (qv) and Missy 'Misdemeanor' Elliott'. The album, titled 'One In A Million' was released on August 27th 1996. In 1998 she released the single, 'Are you that somebody?' from the _Doctor Dolittle (1998)_ (qv) soundtrack, it was produced by her friends 'Tim Mosley (I)' (qv). Later that year she released the single 'Journey to the past', from the _Anastasia (1997)_ (qv) soundtrack. In 2000, she made her film acting debut and starred as Trish O'Day in the smash hit, hip-hop, kung fu film, _Romeo Must Die (2000)_ (qv) alongside 'Jet Li' (qv). The producer was so impressed by her performance she got parts in _The Matrix Reloaded (2003)_ (qv) and _The Matrix Revolutions (2003)_ (qv). She made numerous records for the soundtrack and released 'Try Again', for which she was nominated with 'Best female video' and 'Best Video in a film' with MTV. In 2001 she was nominated with 2 awards for MTV, the 'Breakthrough female' and 'best performing female'. In July 2001 she released her third album, the self-titled, 'Aaliyah'. In early August of the same year she filmed the video for the single 'More Than a woman', taken off the album and on the 23rd August she started filming for 'Rock The Boat', on Abaco Island, in the Bahamas. On 25th August, filming was completed and her and eight of her crew members including her hair stylist and bodyguard boarded a small plane. Shortly after take off, the plane crashed and exploded, Aaliyah and all on board, perished. Aaliyah's funeral was held on Friday August 31st in New York, and 22 white doves were flown to celebrate each year of her life. Soon after her death, the hit singles 'More Than a woman' and 'Rock The Boat' were released from her third album. In 2002, the film _Queen of the Damned (2002)_ (qv) by 'Anne Rice (I)' (qv) was released in which Aaliyah played the lead, Queen Akasha. She was nominated for best Villain at the MTV movie awards 2002.

875,664,19,"Alvar Aalto, one of Finland's most famous people who reshaped architecture and furniture of public buildings on the basis of functionality and organic relationship between man, nature and buildings, is now called the \"Father of Modernism\" in Scandinavian countries.  He was born Hugo Alvar Henrik Aalto, on February 3, 1898, in Kuortane, Finland (at that time Finland was part of Russian Empire). He was the first of three children. His father, J. H. Aalto, was a government surveyor. His mother, Selma Hackestedt, was of Swedish ancestry, she died in 1903. His father remarried and moved the family to the town of Jyvaskyla. There young Aalto attended the Normal School and the Classical Gymnasium, graduating in 1916. During the summer months, young Aalto accompanied his father on surveying trips. From 1916-1921 he studied at the Helsinki University of technology, graduating with a degree in architecture. While a student, Aalto worked for Carolus Lindberg on the design of the \"Tivoli\" area for the 1920 National Fair. At that time Aalto was a protégé of Armas Lingren, partner of E. Saarinen during the formative period of Finnish National architecture of Romanticism. Aalto served in the Finnish National Militia during the Civil War that followed after the Russian Revolution, when the nation of Finland gained independence from Russia.  In 1922-1923 Aalto worked for a project in Sweden, he collaborated with A. Bjerke on the design of the Congress Hall for the 1923 World Fair in Goteborg. He also designed several buildings for the 1922 Industrial fair in Tampere. In 1923 Aalto opened his first architectural office in Juvaskyla. In 1924 he married architect Aino Marsio, they had two children, Johanna (born 1925), and Hamilkar (born 1928). Aalto and his wife had their honeymoon in Italy. The Mediterranean culture made a profound influence on Aalto's creativity, it blended with his Nordic intellect and remained important to his visionary works for the rest of his life. The simple massing and ornamentation of the \"architettura mirwire\" of Northern Italy translated into Aalto's style with its balanced proportions, harmonious volumes rendered in stucco or wood, and sparse decoration with selective use of classical elements. In 1927 the Aaltos moved to the city of Turku. There Alvar Aalto designed the Paimio Sanatorium, a building that elevated him to the status of master of heroic functionalism. He soon moved forward in his pursuit of artistic harmony through organic integration of people and buildings with the environment. Such was his design for the Villa Mairea (1938) in Noormarkku, one of the most admired private residences in contemporary architecture.  In 1933 Aalto moved to Helsinki. There he founded his architecture firm \"Artek\" where he executed his major international commissions, such as Finnish Pavilions for the 1936 Paris World Fair and the 1939-1940 New York's World Fair, libraries in Oregon, USA, and Finland, Opera House in Essen, Germany. His other significant buildings included Baker House at the Massachussetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Mass., USA, Central University Hospital in Zagreb, Croatia, Helsinki Institute of Technology, North Utland Art Museum in Denmark, Nordic House in Reykjavic, Iceland, Public Library in Vyborg, (now Russia), and many other buildings. His later masterpieces include the municipal building in Sayanasalo (1952), the Vuoksenniska Church (1959) and the Finlandia Hall in Helsinki. His works exhibit a range of innovative ideas presented with comforting clarity and carefully crafted balance of intricate and complex forms, spaces, and elements, that are integrated in a simple and well-proportioned way. Aalto's design for the Finnish Pavilion at the 1939 New York's World Fair was described as \"work of genius\" by 'Frank Lloyd Wright (I)' (qv).  Functionalism and synthetic attitude were important in Aalto's evolution from Nordic Classicism towards Modernism. He created his own way of converging forms, materials, and purpose of his buildings on the rationale of their functionality, aesthetics, and comfortable use. Aalto's architecture, furniture, glassware and jewelery evokes multiple allusions to images of unspoiled nature, thus making an ennobling influence on public behavior. He designed 70 buildings for the town of Jyvaskyla, 37 of which were realized, such as the Institute of Pedagogy (1953-1957) and other public buildings. Aalto's ecological awareness was epitomized in his design of the Sunila Cellulose Industry and the residential village for employees (1936 - 1939) and its second stage (1951 - 1954). Aalto's creativity was deeply rooted in his own organic way of life, traditional for the people in Scandinavian countries. \"The very essence of architecture consists of a variety and development reminiscent of natural organic life. This is the only true style in architecture\" said Alvar Aalto.  Alvo Aalto was Chairman of the Arcitects Union and President of the Finnish Academy. His latest building for the Art Museum in Jyvaskyla was named after him. His awards included the Royal Gold Medal from the Royal Institute of British Architects (1957) and the Gold Medal from the American Institute of Architects (1963). Alvar Aalto was featured on the last series of the 50 Finnish mark bill, before the Euro. He died of natural causes on May 11, 1976, in Helsinki and was laid to rest in Hietaniemi Cemetery in Helsinki, Finland.",Steve Shelokhonov

Her first film role was as Little Bo Peep in the film _Fairy Tales (1978)_ (qv). She followed that up by playing Linda \"Boom-Boom\" Bang in _H.O.T.S. (1979)_ (qv). Other film roles included _...All the Marbles (1981)_ (qv), _Scarface (1983)_ (qv), _Bachelor Party (1984)_ (qv), _The Lost Empire (1985)_ (qv), _Basic Training (1985)_ (qv), and _Chopping Mall (1986)_ (qv). She did guest appearances on several television shows, including _\"Cheers\" (1982)_ (qv) and _\"Night Court\" (1984)_ (qv). Her last role was as Penny, a fitness instructor, on _\"The Dom DeLuise Show\" (1987)_ (qv). Angela was found dead at a friend's home in West Hills in the San Fernando Valley on November 27, 1988. The coroner later ruled that her death was a result of a deterioration of the heart muscle, probably caused by a virus. She was 32 at the time.",Don Nelsen <kpaden@cobweb.net>
981,1739801,19,"Beautiful, buxom blond Angela Aames made her mark in Hollywood during the late 1970s and 1980s while appearing in a string of silly T & A comedies and exploitation movies. Additionally, she appeared on numerous TV shows in sexy bit parts that sadly amounted to little more than window dressing.  While she aspired to be a comedienne, her ample curves made her most suitable to play the series of voluptuous party girls and sex kittens that eventually would comprise her resume.  Angela was born February 27, 1956. An early resume indicates that, early, her thespian training included stints at the 'Lee Strasberg' (qv) Theatre Institute and 'Harvey Lembeck' (qv)'s Comedy Workshop, and stage appearances in such theatrical fare as \"Of Mice and Men\", \"The Lion in Winter\", \"A Midsummer Nights Dream\", \"The Importance of Being Earnest\", \"Tartuffe\", \"The Pleasure of his Company\", \"Dark of the Moon\" and \"The Women\".  In addition to Angela's verified credits as published at IMDb, her resume lists a number of other appearances in film and television including the 20-minute educational short called \"Malice in Bigotland\" as well as an industrial short for G.T.E. that dealt with sexual harassment. Also listed are appearances on the Telethon for Autistic Children and Krofft Supershows.  Her television work included bit parts in shows like _\"Barnaby Jones\" (1973)_ (qv), _\"Angie\" (1979)_ (qv), _\"Out of the Blue\" (1979)_ (qv), _\"Mork & Mindy\" (1978)_ (qv), _\"Hill Street Blues\" (1981)_ (qv), _\"Cheers\" (1982)_ (qv), _\"Automan\" (1983)_ (qv) and _\"Alice\" (1976)_ (qv), in addition to her recurring appearances on _\"B.J. and the Bear\" (1978)_ (qv), _\"The Fall Guy\" (1981)_ (qv) and _\"Night Court\" (1984)_ (qv). All featured Angela in tight outfits with copious amounts of cleavage on display. In her _\"Cheers\" (1982)_ (qv) appearance, in the episode called _\"Cheers\" (1982) {Sam's Women (#1.2)}_ (qv), Angela plays her \"bimbo\" role with such skill that her spelling of her name, \"Brandee-with two E's\", is the show's funniest and most memorable line.  In 1983, she appeared on Cinemax's _Likely Stories, Vol. 4 (1983) (TV)_ (qv), playing an 80-foot tall, bikini-clad giantess.  Her earliest film role appears to have been _Fairy Tales (1978)_ (qv), in which she plays a sexier \"Little Bo Peep\" than you've probably seen before. Angela briefly appeared nude in this film, and clips of her nude scene later appeared in made-for-video compilations like _The Best of Sex and Violence (1981)_ (qv) and _Famous T & A (1982) (V)_ (qv). Taking one look at her, Angela was simply made to play the part of Linda \"Boom Boom\" Bangs in _H.O.T.S. (1979)_ (qv), which had her skydiving topless into a swimming pool, among other exploits that made effective use of her frontal anatomy. Her resume also lists an otherwise unknown film from this period, called \"The Crazy\".  Angela appeared in bit parts a number of made-for-TV movies in 1980-81 appearances, which mostly showcased her figure and which included \"Moviola\" (aka _This Year's Blonde (1980) (TV)_ (qv)), _Charlie and the Great Balloon Chase (1981) (TV)_ (qv), _The Comeback Kid (1980) (TV)_ (qv) and _The Perfect Woman (1981) (TV)_ (qv).  The early 1980s saw her topless again in _...All the Marbles (1981)_ (qv). She also appeared, briefly, in _Boxoffice (1982)_ (qv), as a pregnant Hollywood starlet at a posh dinner party. In 1983, Angela had a non-speaking walk-through part in _Scarface (1983)_ (qv).  In 1984, she had arguably her most memorable moment on-screen, in the now-cult classic 'Tom Hanks' (qv) vehicle _Bachelor Party (1984)_ (qv). During the film's opening credits, Aames appears in 'Adrian Zmed' (qv)'s photography studio as a mother having baby pictures taken of her infant child. With a red \"come get me\" top cut practically to her navel, she made indelible impressions on legions of adoring male fans.  Her later film roles, in the mid to late 1980s, included 'Jim Wynorski' (qv)'s _The Lost Empire (1985)_ (qv), _Basic Training (1985)_ (qv) and _Chopping Mall (1986)_ (qv). _The Lost Empire (1985)_ (qv), in particular, allowed Angela to take more of a leading role, demonstrating her fine flair for comedy in addition to her big breasts. There are also some vague Internet references to an appearance in a 1988 \"documentary\" on bodybuilding called \"Flex\" (1988), and also starring Harry Grant and 'Tom Platz' (qv). This is certainly plausible, as Angela had reportedly taken up weightlifting in the years just before her untimely death.  In 1988, she had secured a starring role in the weekly sit-com _\"The Dom DeLuise Show\" (1987)_ (qv), in which she portrayed an aerobics instructor who frequented the beauty and barber shop around which the show revolved. During the show's pilot episode, she made a spectacular entrance, clad in a skin tight leotard, during which 'Dom DeLuise' (qv) commented, to the audience, \"I just love watching her jog!\"  In addition to her numerous TV and film appearances, Angela occasionally modeled. Notably, she was a \"Mint 400 Girl\" in 1982. The \"Mint 400 Girls\" were glamorous race beauty queens integrally involved in the publicity for the prestigious Mint 400 Las Vegas off-road race. She has been featured in a number of publications over the years, including Adam Magazine, Playboy, Partner, Variety, Celebrity Sleuth, Femme Fatales and the National Enquirer.  Angela died unexpectedly on November 27, 1988, of what was officially declared \"heart disease\". She was 32 years old. She is buried in Riverside Cemetery in Pierre, South Dakota, where she was born.  There were actresses who had better roles and who achieved more in their careers, but the fact that, despite her rather lightweight film roles, Angela's fans fondly remember her nearly twenty years after she left us speaks volumes about her cinematic legacy.",Brent Blackburn

1209,900,19,"Baseball's all-time home run king, Hank Aaron did more than hit home runs. Sure, Aaron led the National League (NL) four times, he also was a two-time batting champion and led the league in RBIs four times and runs scored three times. He won the NL's Most Valuable Player award in 1957 and has a lifetime batting average of .305. Aaron got his start playing for the Indianapolis Clowns, of the Negro Leagues before signing on with the Milwaukee Braves. He played at their minor league team in Eau Claire, Wis., one of the first black players there, and was brought up by the Braves in 1954. For the next 23 years, Aaron clobbered Major League pitchers. Never a charismatic player, Aaron often let his bat do the talking. He was the subject of intense media scrutiny in 1973-74 when he approached 'Babe Ruth' (qv)'s hallowed home run record. Aaron received more than 10,000 letters (most of them hate mail and even death threats) during the off-season claiming he should not break the record. Ever the ultimate professional and gentleman, he ignored the insults and slurs and went about the opening season in 1974. On April 8, 1974, Aaron hit his 715th home run, breaking Ruth's record and in doing so, received the undying support of the fans. He finished with 755 overall before retiring after the 1976 season. Aaron was elected to baseball's Hall of Fame in 1982, and now works in the front office for the Atlanta Braves.",Ken Severson

Mark was fortunate to be cast in a number of well received shows at the University of Tennesse Knoxville's Clarence Brown Theatre and tallying weeks in the Candidate/Apprentice Program, he eventually earned his AEA card. Upon graduation with a degree in Political Science, a SAG card and a strong desire to travel, Mark drove south to Houma Louisiana and took a job in the offshore oil field, working as a roughneck on a drilling platform. Six months later after heading out to Southern California with a wallet full of oil money, he was initiated into the milieu with a car accident that left him with a broken neck. There was no nerve damage but the C6 fracture left Mark in a healing mode for several years. Determined to make the best of it, he bought an old upright piano and began putting in hours daily, hammering on those 88's and tackling challenging pieces which he continues to work on with great zeal.

1322,938,19,"Paul Aaron has been creating successful productions since he began his professional career directing a national company of \"The Prime Of Miss Jean Brodie\", starring Oscar-winning actress 'Kim Hunter (I)' (qv). He made an impressive switch to films with the sensitive and critically acclaimed _A Different Story (1978)_ (qv), starring 'Meg Foster (I)' (qv) and 'Perry King' (qv). This film, which now appears regularly in film revival houses and on cable television, has become a \"cult classic\".  Following graduation from Bennington College, Paul Aaron arrived in Los Angeles to become the Casting and New Programs Director for the 'Mark Taper' (qv) Forum. At the same time, he founded an actor's workshop and directed several plays, including a critically acclaimed production of \"The Three Penny Opera\". He was brought to New York to direct the successful, off-Broadway rock musical hit, \"Salvation\", featuring, among others, the then- unknowns 'Bette Midler' (qv), 'Barry Bostwick' (qv) and 'Joe Morton (I)' (qv). He next moved to Broadway to direct the comedy \"Paris Is Out\", starring 'Sam Levene (I)' (qv) and 'Molly Picon' (qv), becoming the youngest director in Broadway history.  After directing the first international company of \"Salvation\" in Amsterdam, he returned to New York to helm, among other plays, the Obie award-winning off-Broadway musical, \"Love My Children\", and, on Broadway, the 'John Kander' (qv) and 'Fred Ebb' (qv) musical, \"70 Girls 70\", the 'Howard Dietz' (qv) and 'Arthur Schwartz (I)' (qv) musical, \"That's Entertainment\", and the American premier of Italian playwright 'Ugo Betti' (qv)'s drama, \"The Burnt Flowerbed\". Variety called his direction of that play \"...nothing less than masterful\".  Soon after moving back to the West Coast, Aaron directed an immensely successful revival of 'Paddy Chayefsky' (qv)'s, \"The Tenth Man\", starring 'Richard Dreyfuss' (qv). He was awarded the Los Angeles Drama Critic's Award as best director of the year for this presentation.  His second feature film as a director, _A Force of One (1979)_ (qv), an action-thriller staring 'Chuck Norris' (qv) and 'Jennifer O'Neill (I)' (qv), with a screenplay by Academy Award-winner 'Ernest Tidyman' (qv), was a tremendous box office success.  Paul's next challenge was to direct 'William Gibson (I)' (qv)'s classic, _The Miracle Worker (1979) (TV)_ (qv), starring 'Patty Duke' (qv) and 'Melissa Gilbert (I)' (qv). This NBC Special Event not only garnered some of the network's highest ratings for the season, but also won Paul a number of distinguished awards, both here and abroad. These include a Director's Guild nomination, the Director's prize from the Monte Carlo Film Festival, a Golden Globe nomination and the Christopher Award. \"The Miracle Worker\" was nominated for four Emmys and won three, including one for 'Patty Duke' (qv) as \"Lead Actress in a Dramatic Special\" and, even more impressive, the Emmy as \"Outstanding Dramatic Special\" of the 1979-1980 season.  For his next project, he chose to direct the CBS movie, _Thin Ice (1981) (TV)_ (qv), starring 'Kate Jackson (I)' (qv) and the venerable film star, 'Lillian Gish' (qv).  He followed \"Thin Ice\" with a return to Broadway, directing 'Claudette Colbert' (qv) in \"A Talent For Murder\", an original suspense-comedy that turned out to be her last work on the stage.  Next on film was the CBS Special, _Maid in America (1982) (TV)_ (qv), starring 'Mildred Natwick' (qv), 'Susan Clark (I)' (qv) and 'Fritz Weaver' (qv). Aaron then directed the ABC film, _When She Says No (1984) (TV)_ (qv), which starred 'Kathleen Quinlan' (qv), 'Jane Alexander (I)' (qv) and 'Rip Torn' (qv).  Aaron's company, \"Elsboy Entertainment\", purchased and developed the 'Jack Finney (I)' (qv) novel, \"Marion's Wall\", and Aaron adapted it for the screen with 'Patricia Resnick' (qv), who wrote the screenplay. The movie, entitled _Maxie (1985)_ (qv), starring 'Glenn Close' (qv) and 'Mandy Patinkin' (qv) and directed by Aaron, was produced in association with \"Elsboy Entertainment\" and was released by Orion Pictures.  He then directed the award-winning NBC television special, _In Love and War (1987) (TV)_ (qv), the story of Adm. 'Jim Stockdale' (qv), which starred 'James Woods (I)' (qv) and 'Jane Alexander (I)' (qv). \"In Love and War\" garnered brilliant reviews and was chosen by The Hollywood Reporter as one of the top five shows televised during the season.  Aaron had also been concentrating on building a successful management and production company under the umbrella of \"Elsboy Entertainment\". In 1992, he sold the management division of his company to 'Erwin Stoff' (qv), who had worked with him for fifteen years. They met when Paul was a guest professor at the University of Washington in Seattle where Erwin was a grad student. Together, they developed the careers of several now-famous actors, writers and directors.  The reason Paul decided to leave the rigors of running a full-time management company was to concentrate on his writing and producing. The first project he sold was a three-hour mini-series for HBO, entitled _Laurel Avenue (1993) (TV)_ (qv), which he executive-produced, co-created and wrote with 'Michael Henry Brown' (qv). It aired in 1993 and was called \"a golden moment in the history of television\", by Pulitzer prize-winning critic 'Tom Shales' (qv) of the Washington Post.  Paul returned to directing with a film, for the Lifetime Cable Network, entitled, _Untamed Love (1994) (TV)_ (qv). It is based on the book, \"One Child\", by 'Torey Hayden' (qv), and recounts the extraordinary true story of her work with special education students in the public schools.  Aaron's next project was a one-hour dramatic series for CBS entitled, _\"Under One Roof\" (1995)_ (qv), which he executive-produced with 'Michael Henry Brown' (qv) and 'Thomas Carter (II)' (qv), and which he co-created and co-wrote. It starred 'James Earl Jones' (qv) and 'Joe Morton (I)' (qv).  The summer of 1996 saw the premiere of _Grand Avenue (1996) (TV)_ (qv), a three-hour dramatic mini-series based on the book of the same title by 'Greg Sarris' (qv). Aaron and \"Elsboy Entertainment\" executive-produced the project with 'Robert Redford (I)' (qv) and his company, Wildwood Enterprises, Inc. This saga of three Native American families in Santa Rosa, California, was the first major exploration of contemporary Indian life on American television. It won critical acclaim among both the Native American and mainstream audiences, and scored the highest rating of any HBO program of the season. Paul is continuing to develop \"Calle Ocho\" (Eighth Street), the next installment in his 'American family' series for HBO, which focuses on an extended Cuban-American family in Miami.  In addition, Paul recently did a rewrite for \"Jerry Bruckheimer Films\" and another for 'Robert DeNiro''s \"Tribeca Films\" with his former writing partner, 'Michael Henry Brown' (qv). They also wrote \"Land of Opportunity\" (2000), adapted from the book by 'William Adler (I)' (qv), and \"Shadowman\" (2000), based on the popular comic book, both for New Line Pictures. Their original screenplay _In Too Deep (1999)_ (qv) was made into a major motion picture by Miramax Films which Paul also produced. 'Roger Ebert' (qv), among many other critics, gave the film two very \"big thumbs up\".  In 2005, Paul produced his most recent feature, _Looking for Sunday (2006)_ (qv), starring 'Michael Weston (I)' (qv), 'Orlando Jones' (qv) and 'Katharine Towne' (qv), independently, with the hopes for release in 2006.  Currently, Paul is producing the independent film which Suntaur developed, _Skills Like This (2007)_ (qv).",James Waugh

It not only earned him positive reviews from 'Roger Ebert' (qv) and AOL Critics Choice, but it soon became an underground favorite.

Lloyd first had his eyes on George Auger ('Cardiff Giant' (qv)) who worked at Ringling Brothers sideshow as a giant. But Auger died before the film started and a search went out for a replacement. The producer 'Hal Roach (I)' (qv) heard of a shoemaker that was constructing a pair of shoes for a \"Norwegian living in Minnesota\", and his name was John Aasen. His mother was Kristi Danielsen (b. 1868) from Numedal in Norway. She emigrated to the US via Liverpool during spring of 1887. It is not 100% certain who Aasen's father was, but while working in Eggedal, Norway, Kristi Danielsen met the Swedish Nils Jansson Bokke who reached a prominent 244 cm in height. It had to have been \"The clash of the Titans\" when the couple met as Aasen's mother had her own merit with the height of 220cm. But the passenger list on board D/S \"Rollo\" listed Kristi Danielsen as single. Later that year Aasen was born and we can only speculate if his father was the Swede. Some sources lists him as 273 cm tall and with a weight of 251 kilos. Nearly 8 meters of material was needed to make him a suit. In other words; impressive! The annual Nummedalslagets yearbook of 1925 wrote: \"Apparently the world's tallest human (in the civilized world) with a loving and sympathetic personality who always appears courteous and modest. In 'Harold Lloyd (I)' (qv)'s film classic, _Why Worry? (1923)_ (qv) , Aasen plays \"Colosso\". He is suffering from a toothache and stuck in jail with other prisoners of a revolution in Chile. Lloyd is Harold von Palham as the rich hypochondriac who ends up in the same prison as \"Colosso\" and cures him of his toothache. Forever grateful \"Colosso\" aids van Palham in his adventures as escapees from the prison. With a cannon on his back and bullets hanging from his neck, the pair becomes an unusual couple who create comic mayhem. The film became one of the largest box-office attractions of 1923. Aasen was a great success in his first film and appeared in several others, but not with the same impact. It is said he mastered Norwegian fluently and for many years performed as a \"Sideshow\" attraction for C.A. Wortham Shows. He died on the 1st August 1938 in Mendocino, California.",Niels Solberg/nielspe@online.no

She accredits her love for folk/bluegrass music to her Dad. \"Growing up, most kids listened to 'The Wheels on the Bus', I listened to Peter, Paul and Mary\" Kara once said. She began acting in grade school, and carried her love of the art into high school and college. Working as a full-time second grade teacher, Kara spends her summers working as a movie extra and in local theatre productions. Kara would love to work in the Indie film industry someday, if the opportunity presented itself. She is also an accomplished bluegrass alto, and is teaching herself to play the Bluegrass Fiddle. Kara graduated from The Moody Bible Institute in 2009 with a BA in elementary education. She married her college sweetheart, Art, in 2009. Kara prefers rural life to that of city or even suburban. \"If I ever make it big, our second home will be in the Smoky Mountains of East Tennessee\" Kara said in 2010. For now, she is content residing in the Chicago suburb of Lockport, IL with Art and their cat, Skittles. Her mom and dad live across the street.",Kara Abarca

Allison has made a career of working on some of the most innovative animated features in the business. A native of New York, Abbate relocated to Hollywood in 1989 where she started at Disney and served as an artistic coordinator on Tim Burton's cult classic The Nightmare Before Christmas.  Abbate then moved to Paris for The Walt Disney Company to set-up their satellite animation studio and co-produce the Academy Award-nominated Mickey Mouse short Runaway Brain.  In 1996, Abbate joined Warner Bros. where she co-produced the international hit feature Space Jam which combined classic animated Warner Bros. characters with live action sequences. This film, headlined by Bugs Bunny, Michael Jordan and Bill Murray, broke new ground in animated features.  She then went on to earn a BAFTA award in 1999, as producer of Brad Bird's internationally acclaimed Iron Giant, an adaptation of British Poet Laureate Ted Hughes' acclaimed children's' book, The Iron Man.  She followed up her success on Iron Giant producing Looney Tunes Back in Action, another family comedy which teamed Bugs Bunny and Daffy Duck with Brendan Fraser and Steve Martin. Abbate then moved to London in 2004 to produce the haunting musical feature, Corpse Bride with Johnny Depp and Helena Bonham Carter with director Tim Burton. Corpse Bride was also nominated for an Oscar in 2005.  In 2006 she joined forces with acclaimed filmmaker Wes Anderson to produce the Fantastic Mr Fox, a stop motion adaptation of Roald Dahl's beloved children's story featuring the voices of George Clooney and Meryl Streep.

We shouldn't be making films to satisfy funding criteria or industry peers, it should just be about the audience and what they want, because at the end of the day, it's them, which includes you and me, that's ultimately going to decided whether a film fails or not. They're the boss. That's it. It sounds simple, I know, but if you look at our box office figures in the past decade, we're obviously missing the mark somewhere. I think there's a very positive movement happening at the moment in the independent sector which is starting to show the depth of filmmaking talent this country has to offer and our want to tell stories that appeal to a wider fan-base.",

His mother Fortune was an entertainer who had traveled the world as a cabaret artist and his father was a Bank Manager. He is of Sri Lankan heritage but mixed with Dutch, Portuguese and German descent. Bay was born Stefan Jason Abeydeera but changed his name later in life as people could never get his surname correct when spelling it and he wanted a easy to remember name for his entertaining.  Bay was raised along with his only sister Yasmine who is 11 years his junior and a singer. He shared his childhood with his parents, sister and grandparents who lived with him and had a high influence on his life especially his grandfather Edward. His parents wanting him to defend himself when he was older started him at Judo at the age of 5 and then Tae Kwon Do at 11 where he went on to obtain his black belt. Loving the movement of the human body Bay took up lifting weights and then bodybuilding at 17 and completed his high school certificate this same year. He was accepted into Latrobe University to study Biological Sciences where he stayed for 1 year until he joined the Victorian Police Force in 1989. During his 6 years in the force he started his first band called Wild Knights; and started taking extra roles in film and television often as a police officer.  Wanting to get a crash course in acting he starting taking any course he could to harness his acting skills. He attended the National Theatre in St.Kilda, Australia and well as studying method acting. Australia not having a lot of parts for his ethnicity he joined an acting agency that dealt with multicultural people. During this period he was touring around the cabaret circuit and a singer, actor, dancer and booked a small part in the television movie The Diamond of Jeru, with Billy Zane in 2001. Continually singing to make his money he then auditioned for The Quiet American, with Brendan Fraser and got a small part but it was unfortunately dropped from the film script before being filmed.

He has been working in the film and video business for over 14 years on numerous feature films, commercials and music videos as a sound technician, music video editor and director. Born in New York and raised in Harlem by his mother Aisha Farid. Abdul's father, Randy Abbott was a film director, photographer and director of the Studio Museum of Harlem. Abdul was a member of the Boys Choir of Harlem before attending the acclaimed High School of Music & Art as a visual artist. During those four years of studying art at M&A, he attended the School of Visual Arts' film animation programs on the weekends. There he studied animation techniques and applications. Looking up to his film idols, 'George Lucas (I)' (qv) and 'Steven Spielberg' (qv), Abdul realized he had a stronger love for \"live\" film making. After graduating from M&A, Abdul enrolled in the School of Visual Arts with film being his major and worked during the summer as a P.A. and Intern on several feature films. He also worked at the Downtown Community Television center, learning the process of video production, editing, lighting, camera and sound, as well as directing documentaries and narratives. Abdul graduated from S.V.A at the top of his class with a Bachelor's degree in fine arts and a completed thesis film titled \"99%\". The film's content and style was unlike any other film in his graduating class. He was completely influenced by the images that he saw on the then new music channel, MTV. Its slick lighting, camera work, fashion and quick edits forever changed his way of thinking about filmmaking and storytelling. During the next few years, Abdul worked as a sound technician on several feature films including, _Def by Temptation (1990)_ (qv) , _City of Hope (1991)_ (qv) and 'Spike Lee' (qv)'s _Do the Right Thing (1989)_ (qv) and _Mo' Better Blues (1990)_ (qv). Eventually, he started working on music videos as the sound \"playback\" technician. Soon, Abdul put his skills as an editor to the test when he convinced a friend/director, 'Millicent Shelton' (qv) to let him edit a Kwame music video for her. That was the start of his second career. He started editing for other directors such as 'Paris Barclay' (qv), 'Darnell Martin' (qv), 'Lionel C. Martin' (qv) and 'Hype Williams' (qv). Abdul's big break came when 'Ann Carli' (qv) at Jive records gave him a chance to direct a video for a new Hip Hop group called \"2 Too Many\", a group formed and produced by 'Will Smith (I)' (qv). After completing the video, he began shopping his reel as a director/editor. Abdul soon landed his next video for a jazz track by the legendary singer/actress 'Abbey Lincoln' (qv). The video \"People In Me\", landed Abdul a Gold Award for \"Best jazz video\" in the 1993 Worldfest film festival. In 1994 he was commissioned to direct a video for a hip-hop trio called \"Original Flavor\". The track was called \"All that\". That is where he met the group's manager 'Damon Dash (I)' (qv) and his partner 'Jay-Z' (qv) of Roc-a-fella records. Abdul was soon hired to directed 'Jay-Z' (qv)'s first video, \"I Can't Get Wit That\", at a final budget of $5000. Then the 'Jay-Z' (qv) video \"In My Lifetime\" was soon to follow. That video was one of the first \"Big Baller\"-type videos that are now commonly seen, exploiting the images of wealth, champagne, diamonds, girls and bravado. In the next few years Abdul directed several other videos for 'Jay-Z' (qv) including the #1 videos for the songs \"Ain't NoÉ\" (featuring 'Foxy Brown (I)' (qv)) and \"Dead Presidents\" as well videos for other artists, including the Motown artists, Shades, The Whitehead Bros. and Ladae . Abdul also directed and edited a \"live\" concert video for Columbia Records artist 'Kenny Lattimore' (qv), which was featured on a BET special and featured on an ABC networks \"live in concert\" special. Over the years Abdul has also had his hand in role of Producer, producing 'Naughty By Nature (I)' (qv)'s first video \"O.P.P\" for 'Marcus Raboy' (qv) and music videos for C-Money directed by 'Jeff Byrd (I)' (qv), Poor Righteous Teachers and co-producing several videos with his Producer 'Schavaria Reeves' (qv). In the late 90s Abdul collaborated with 'Damon Dash (I)' (qv), 'Jay-Z' (qv) and 'Cha-Ka Pilgrim' (qv) of Roc-a-fella Records to direct a series of \"B-side\" videos interwoven with narrative skits for 'Jay-Z' (qv)'s new album. The project was shot over an eight-day period with an extremely modest budget. The project was entitled _Streets Is Watching (1998) (V)_ (qv). It was released in 1998 and was huge hit amongst new and old fans, earning the #1 slot for several weeks in Billboard magazine's \"long form music video category\". The long- form-mini-movie sold well over 100,000 units, becoming a certified \"Platinum\" video. Abdul has also directed hit videos for ALL CITY - \"The Hot Joint\", \"The Actual\", \"Priceless\", Killah Priest \"One Step\", Lord Finesse, Sauce Money, Jive recording artists, Caffeine, \"Ride With Me\", and Pastor Hezekiah Walker & The Love Fellowship Crusade Choir's track, \"Let's Dance\". \"State Property\" (Get Down or Lay Down) has recently been screened with rave reviews at the 2001 UrbanWorld Film Festival in NYC.",vanessawhistler1971@hotmail.com

2467,3564687,19,"Brooke Abbott is a filmmaker, philanthropist and mother with a passion for the arts, history, green living and community which she incorporates into all of her projects including charity, film and photography. Born and raised in Los Angeles, she is the middle of nine children with both parents living and working in the entertainment industry. As a child, Brooke's mother was very involved in local social causes and philanthropic work. She made sure the Brooke and her siblings understood the value of humanity and giving were standard practices in their household. Given her background it's easy to see how Brooke became enamored by the art of giving and of performance while watching her siblings and parents take projects from the seed of an idea to a dream come true for themselves and others.  After completing high school, Brooke decided to become a director of film & television. She graduated from The Academy of Art University in San Francisco where she completed several endearing short film projects that dealt with love, relationships and women working in the industry.  Upon graduation, Brooke moved back down to Los Angeles and worked through several internships at HBO Films, Yvette Lee Bowser and SisterLee Productions and finally took a job with Actor/Author/Philanthropist Holly Robinson Peete and husband Ex-NFL Star/Philanthropist/Author Rodney Peete for their non-profit organization, The HollyRod Foundation. Brooke's interest in non-profit funding and philanthropy grew as she worked with the Peete's to help families who had members living with Parkinson's Disease & Autism receive proper therapies, treatments and care for a better quality of life. Brooke continued her work with the Peete's and the HollyRod Foundation for a years along with continuing her passion for filmmaking by working on independent projects and network shows such as \"Half & Half\", \"Desperate Housewives\" & \"The Bridget Show\".  In 2008, Brooke found love with Steven Honeycutt and in late 2009 they welcomed their first son, Jaxon Lee Coltrane Honeycutt. While taking a sabbatical from work to focus on her family, Brooke came up with an idea to open a after school program housed in a sustainable building for the high school students of New Orleans, LA. From this idea, Brooke & Steven started work on building their own non-profit foundation, The HoneyBrooke Foundation that will not only fund their sustainable after school house program, but other programs & foundations that will work toward helping our youth receive a better education, learn how to live & support their community & live a better quality of life. The fundamentals instilled in Brooke at an early age aren't allowing her to quit any dreams, instead allowing her to embrace all talents and passions while contributing to humanity.",Anonymous

2527,1989,19,"Long acknowledged as one of the best \"straight men\" in the business, Bud Abbott worked in carnivals while still a child and dropped out of school in 1909. He worked as assistant treasurer for the Casino Theater in Brooklyn, then as treasurer and/or manager of various theaters around the country. He worked as the straight man to such vaudeville and burlesque comics as Harry Steepe and Harry Evanson while managing the National Theater in Detroit. In 1931 while cashiering at the Brooklyn theater, he substituted for comic 'Lou Costello (I)' (qv)'s ill straight-man. The two clicked almost immediately and formed their famous comedy team. Throughout the 1930s they worked burlesque, minstrel shows, vaudeville and movie houses. In 1938 they got national exposure through the 'Kate Smith (I)' (qv) radio show \"The Kate Smith Hour\", and signed with Universal Pictures the next year. They made their film debut in _One Night in the Tropics (1940)_ (qv), and, while the team wasn't the film's stars, it made money for Universal and they got good enough notices to convince Universal to give them their own picture. Their first starring film, _Buck Privates (1941)_ (qv), with 'The Andrews Sisters' (qv), grossed what was then a company-record $10 million (on a $180,000 budget) and they were on their way to stardom and a long run as the most popular comedy team in America. In 1942 they topped a poll of Hollywood stars. They had their own radio show (ABC, 1941-6, NBC, 1946-9) and TV show (_\"The Abbott and Costello Show\" (1952)_ (qv)). After the war their careers stalled and the box-office takes for their films started slipping. However, they made a big comeback in _Bud Abbott Lou Costello Meet Frankenstein (1948)_ (qv), which raked in huge profits and even got the team good notices from critics who normally wouldn't even review their films. The movie's success convinced Universal to embark on a series of films in which the team met various monsters or found themselves in exotic locations. Their film career eventually petered out and the team split up in 1957. Costello embarked on a series of TV appearances and even made a film, without Abbott, called _The 30 Foot Bride of Candy Rock (1959)_ (qv), but it was a flop. He received good notices after a dramatic performance in an episode of _\"Wagon Train\" (1957)_ (qv) and was in discussion to star in a biography of famed New York City mayor 'Fiorello LaGuardia' (qv), a project Costello had been trying to get off the ground for years, when he died. Both Abbott and Costello had major tax problems with the Internal Revenue Service and wound up virtually broke. Abbott started over with a new partner, 'Candy Candido' (qv), in the 1960s and set off on a national tour, including Las Vegas, but the act failed. In 1966 he voiced his character in a cartoon version of their television show. His health deteriorated badly in the late 1960s, he had always suffered from epilepsy, and he died in 1974.",Ed Stephan <stephan@cc.wwu.edu>

Born in 1965 in Huntingbeach, California, Abbott was a college wrestler who got interested in bare-knuckle fighting on the beaches of Southern California. The 6 feet 270 pound Abbott was undefeated in the art of Pit-Fighting. Pit-Fighting is a sport started by outlaw biker gangs in which a large pit is dug and two fighters jump in and brawl. This \"sport\" was depicted in the film, Stone Cold. Taking an undefeated record of 8-0, 8 knockouts into the Ultimate Fighting Championships in 1995, Abbott set the mixed martial arts world ablaze with his awesome one-punch knockout power. Over the next 8 years he scored impressive wins over a host of undefeated fighters; 300 pound John Matua KO 1(1995), 6ft.8inch. 300lbs. Paul \"Polar Bear\" Varlans KO 1(1995), 250 pound Steve Nelmark KO 1(1996), 220 pound Hugh Duarte who was 8-0 in 1 roound(1998). Abbott also beat two Martial Arts World Champions, undefeated UFC CHampion Steve Jennum by TKO in 1995 and GC Champion Cal Worsham in 1996. The Tank failed in his three bids to capture a world championship being defeated by Oleg Taktarov in 1995, Don Frye in 1996, and Maurice Smith in 1997. Abbott was a professional wrestler for about 4 years and scored a number of quick knockouts in special wrestling \"shoot-matches\".

2665,1740347,19,"Perennial starlet Dorothy Abbott was a sexy, vivacious, wide-smiling model, showgirl and actress who could brighten up a room. Unfortunately, her cinematic offerings wound up being pretty minimal and her last years were marred by depression and, ultimately, a tragic end.  She was born Dorothy E. Abbott on December 16, 1920, in Kansas City, Missouri and started her career off as a chorine with 'Earl Carroll (I)' (qv) and his Los Angeles-based revues and in Las Vegas showrooms where she was dubbed the rather mystifying title of \"The Girl with the Golden Arm\". Paramount Studios perked up on the lovely blonde with the Betty Page-like bangs and gave her a starting contract at $150 a week. Groomed in dozens of decorative \"good time girl\" bits -- dancers, chorus girls, waitresses, stewardesses, party girls, nurses and models -- she was at the same time promoted as a cheesecake pinup, \"winning\" such dubious titles as \"Miss Wilshire Club,\" \"Miss Los Angeles Transit\" and \"Miss Oil Cans\".  The dusky-voiced Dorothy was usually briefly seen and not heard in such dramatic and lightweight fare as _The Razor's Edge (1946)_ (qv), _Road to Rio (1947)_ (qv), _Night Has a Thousand Eyes (1948)_ (qv) (in which she has her first speaking role as a maid), _Words and Music (1948)_ (qv), _Take Me Out to the Ball Game (1949)_ (qv), _Little Women (1949)_ (qv), _Neptune's Daughter (1949)_ (qv), _Annie Get Your Gun (1950)_ (qv), _His Kind of Woman (1951)_ (qv), _Aaron Slick from Punkin Crick (1952)_ (qv), _The Las Vegas Story (1952)_, _The Caddy (1953)_ (qv), _There's No Business Like Show Business (1954)_ (qv), _Love Me or Leave Me (1955)_ (qv), _Rebel Without a Cause (1955)_ (qv), _Gunfight at the O.K.

Her one starring role came early in the exploitative, lowbudget potboiler _A Virgin in Hollywood (1953)_ (qv) as a star reporter out to get a seamy Hollywood story, but she was unable to capitalize on it.  Working bit parts at the studio during the days, she would often perform on stage in little theatre shows at night. On the sly, when work was meager, she became a real estate agent in the 1950s in order to help supplement her income. TV chores included guest roles in \"Leave It to Beaver\" and \"Ozzie and Harriet\". She also had a recurring part for one season as 'Jack Webb (I)' (qv)'s girlfriend on the _Dragnet (1954)_ (qv) series.  Dorothy married LAPD narcotics squad officer-turned homicide detective Adolph Rudy Diaz in 1949. Diaz, who was of Native American (Apache) descent, eventually retired as a cop in order to pursue acting. By this time, the marriage was in trouble and the couple separated. Going by the stage name of 'Rudy Diaz (I)' (qv) in 1967, he began to get work and was seen out in public with other women. The divorce was finalized in 1968, but Dorothy took it hard and never seemed to get over it. On December 15, 1968, she committed suicide at her Los Angeles home -- one day before her 48th birthday. She was interred (as Dorothy E. Diaz) at Rose Hills Memorial Park, Whittier, Los Angeles County, California, Plot: Valley Lawn, Lot 2939.",Gary Brumburgh / gr-home@pacbell.net

Raised in New York City, he is a dual citizen of the USA and Antigua.  In college he majored in psychology and minored in music and dramatic arts. He holds a Masters degree and is currently working towards his Ph.D and was awarded a Wallace Stegner Fellowship to Stanford University's Creative writing Masters program. While pursuing graduate studies at Berkeley, and Stanford he helped pay his tuition by starting a band. It was here he developed his own personal musical style. While teaching English at Berkeley, he decided to become a professional musician, built a studio, and applied his academic discipline to developing skills as a singer, composer and producer.  Abbott released the single and album \"Shake You Down\" shaking up the music industry with countless honors and awards. \"Shake You Down\" has become the first and fastest song in the history of BMI to reach one million radio airplay's (now well over three million), and won BMI's Pop Song of the Year award. He's had numerous top five hits both performed by himself as well as produced and written for other artists. Abbotts' music has crossed every barrier imaginable. You hear the Caribbean/Spanish influence in his music, topped off with his incredibly smooth, soulful voice.  Abbotts' music has gone to number one on charts all over the world. He's won first prize at the Tokyo Music Festival, two \"Soul Train\" music awards, has been the star of the New York Music Awards, (receiving four), and two CEBA Awards (Communications Excellence Aimed at Black Audiences) among many many others.  Abbott comes from a family of entertainers. His first cousin Diahnne Abbott was for many years married to actor Robert De Niro, and is herself an actor of merit. Gregory has guest starred on the daytime drama \"All My Children\" and is now delving more heavily into acting and film production.  Some of his community service work includes Rock Against Drugs, joining them when they brought their message to Washington, DC. He has also participated in the \"Bands to Beat AIDS\" campaign focused on AIDS awareness across the US. Abbott has served on the Board of Directors of both NARAS (the Grammys'), and the NAPM (Songwriters Hall of Fame). His own foundation supports aspiring musical talent.",gregoryabbott.com

3569,2669,19,"Vadim Abdrashitov, one of Russian cinema's most independent directors who was influenced by liberation of cultural life during the Khrushchev's \"Thaw\", is now an internationally renown filmmaker with awards from the Berlin and Venice Film Festivals.  He was born Vadim Yusupovich Abdrashitov on January 19, 1945, in Kharkov, Ukraine, USSR (now Kharkov, Ukraine). His father, Yusup Abdrashitov, an ethnic Tatar, was an officer in the Soviet Army and for that reason his family was moving many times to places like Vladivostok, Alma-Ata, Sakhalin, Kamchatka and Leningrad. Young Abdrashitov was so impressed with the space flight of the first Russian cosmonaut 'Yuri Gagarin' (qv), that he left his parents in Kazakhstan, and moved to Moscow. There he studied nuclear physics at the famous 'FisTech' where the Nobel Prize Laureats Landau, Tamm, and Semyonov were among professors.  At that time Abdrashitov became involved in amateur film-making. Then he transfered to the Mendeleev Institute of Technology, because it was equipped with the film studio for students. His cultural and artistic interests developed during the \"Thaw\", that was initiated by 'Nikita Khrushchev' (qv). Abdrashitov was influenced by the books of 'Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn' (qv) and 'Vasili Aksyonov' (qv), and by the songs of 'Vladimir Vysotskiy (I)' (qv), Yuri Vizbor, 'Bulat Okudzhava' (qv), and 'Aleksandr Galich' (qv). After graduation as an engineer, he worked as a manager at the Moscow Electric-Vaccuum Industry, which was making color TV tubes.  From 1970-1974 Abdrashitov studied film directing under 'Mikhail Romm' (qv) at the Moscow State Institute of Cinematography (VGIK). After the death of Romm, he continued his film studies under 'Lev Kulidzhanov' (qv) and graduated as a film director. His directorial debut was _Ostanovite Potapova! (1974)_ (qv), a satirical comedy based on the screenplay by 'Grigori Gorin' (qv). In 1975 Abdrashitov met with the unknown writer 'Aleksandr Mindadze' (qv). That was the beginning of their fruitful collaboration in their next 12 films, which they made together in 30 years. Their films were awarded at many international film festivals as well as at the Soviet and Russian film forums. Abdrashitov became Laureat of the Russian State Prize for his film _Ostanovilsya poyezd (1982)_ (qv). In _Parad planet (1986)_ (qv), an existential film, starring 'Oleg Borisov (I)' (qv), 'Sergey Shakurov' (qv), and 'Sergey Nikonenko' (qv) with others, seven men are trying to find their way back home after a military training in which they were \"killed\" by an enemy's missile, and seized to exist. In search for their way home they go through mystical experiences in the battlefield, then in a \"city of women\", in a retirement home, and finally they witness a Parade of the Planets, a rare cosmic event that happens once in a thousand years.  Abdrashitov and Mindadze has been enjoying continuous and fruitful collaboration which had resulted in many critically acclaimed works. Their _Plyumbum, ili opasnaya igra (1987)_ (qv) was awarded the Gold Medal at the 44-th Venice International film Festival. Abdrashitov was made Laureat of the USSR State Prize for his film _Sluga (1989)_ (qv), which was also awarded the Alfred Bower Prize from the Ecumenic Jury at the Berlin Film Festival (1991). Their haunting film _Vremya tantsora (1998)_ (qv), with remarkable acting by 'Sergey Garmash' (qv) and 'Chulpan Khamatova' (qv), received several awards and nominations. Their latest _Magnitnye buri (2003)_ (qv) (aka.. Magnetic Storms) is an apocalyptic, anti-Utopian, almost \"pavlovian\" analysis of provincial life in Russia, where people are programmed to become zombies, trapped in a vicious cycle of work for survival and the only events that bring variety to their monotonous life are occasional sparks of bloody fist-fights - albeit powerless to change the general doom.  Vadim Abdrashitov is a Member of the Russian Film Academy and a Member of the Russian Union of Cinematographers. He received numerous awards and nominations at Russian and International film festivals and was designated People's Artist of Russia in 1992. Vadim Abdrashitov has been enjoying a happy family life with his wife, Natella Toidze, and their two children, son Oleg (born in 1973) and daughter Naina (born in 1980).

She branched out into singing with her first CD, \"Forever Your Girl\", which had lackluster sales until the single \"Straight Up\" exploded onto the charts in December 1988 and she has been a popular singer/dancer ever since, enhanced by her stint as a judge on the hit series _\"American Idol: The Search for a Superstar\" (2002)_ (qv).",Pete Brennan

Daughter of Harry Abdul (once a livestock trader in Brazil) and Lorainne Abdul (former assistant to film director 'Billy Wilder' (qv), grew up in Hollywood, California. Since the age of seven, she sung and danced in community musical theatre groups while traveling around America. She took tap dance lessons as well, in which she was awarded a scholarship to tap dancing school. Later on in life, she attended Cal State-Northridge College in which she majored in Broadcast radio. During that time, she auditioned for the Los Angeles Lakers NBA Cheerleading team, and that led her to a spot as a cheerleader on the squad earning some $50 a game during her freshman year.  Later on she decided to take up choreography, working with artists such as the Jacksons and the Rolling Stones. Nowadays, she organises dance camps for young children to come to and have fun during the summer.

He was almost mystical in his approach, yet that approach only strengthened our confidence. Coach Wooden enjoyed winning, but he did not put winning above everything.

3858,3064022,19,"Alexander Nicholayevitch Romanoff (Achmed Abdullah) was the author of numerous adventure and mystery stories, usually set in strange and exotic locations.  His father, Grand Duke Nicholas Romanoff, was a cousin of 'Tsar Nicholas II' (qv) of Russia and his mother, Princess Nourmahal Durani, was the daughter of the Amir of Afghanistan. Alexander, along with his brother Yar and sister Gothia, were born at the Romanoff Palace in Yalta, the future site of the historic Second World War conference among 'Winston Churchill (I)' (qv), 'Franklin D. Roosevelt' (qv) and 'Joseph Stalin' (qv). After pressure from the Afghan and Russian royal houses forced their parents to divorce, Alexander--along with his sister--went to live with their uncle in Afghanistan; Yar, the oldest, stayed with his father in Russia. Alexander was adopted by his uncle, who changed his name to Achmed Abdullah Nadir Khan el-Durani el Iddrissyeh and raised him in the Muslim faith. Yar became an officer in the Russian army and was killed in 1914 at the Battle of Tannenberg. Gothia was said to have married an Indian rajah. In 1936, after years of being torn between the Russian Orthodox Church he was baptized in and the Muslim faith he was raised in, Abdullah became a Roman Catholic.  He went to schools in Afghanistan, India, France and finally England, where he attended Eton and Oxford. Upon graduation he became a British citizen and joined the British army, where he served with merit in China, Tibet, Russia, Eastern Europe, France, India and Africa. Because of his ability to blend in with different cultures, he was often called upon by British Intelligence to work as a spy. Not long after Abdullah retired from the British army with the rank of captain, he joined the Turkish army and fought with distinction in the First Balkan War (1912-1913). By the time Abdullah decided to pursue a writing career his life experiences had gained him a plethora of material to draw upon for decades to come.  Abdullah began writing in earnest after coming to the US sometime after 1914. Soon stories like \"The Blue Eyed Manchu\", \"The Red Stain\", \"The Soul Catcher\" and \"Bucking the Tiger\" were appearing in newspapers and magazines across the country. By the early 1920s he was writing for both the stage and the screen. In 1928 he published a collection of ballads and poems from Central Asia entitled \"Lute and Scimitar\". His autobiography, \"The Cat Had Nine Lives\" (1933), reads like one of his romantic adventure stories. In 1937 he wrote with John Kenney, a cookbook entitled, \"For Men Only\". Abdullah's first Broadway play, \"The Honourable Mr. Wong\" (1932), was adapted from his story \"The Hatchetman\" and was written with the help of 'David Belasco (I)' (qv) around the time he became a permanent resident of the US. Though many of his stories and plays were very popular with the public, he will probably always be best remembered for the classic films _The Thief of Bagdad (1924)_ (qv) and _The Lives of a Bengal Lancer (1935)_ (qv).  Abdullah must have cut quite an imposing figure when seen out in public, with his military posture, impeccable suit, hat tilted just so, gray spats and monocled eye. In 1945 he passed away on his birthday at Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center in New York after an illness of several months. He was survived by his third wife, Rosemary Dutton, whom he married in 1940, a year after his second wife of 20 years, literary agent Jean Wick, had passed away. His first wife, Irene Augusta Bainbridge, was still married to him when he filled out his Word War One draft registration card in 1918.",John F. Barlow (qv's & corrections by A. Nonymous)

3921,2954,19,"Aleksandr Abdulov, one of Russian cinema's best known sex symbols who refused to serve the Communist Party and suffered a blow to his career, was one of the most celebrated Russian film stars.  He was born Aleksandr Gavrilovich Abdulov on May 29, 1953, in Tobolsk, Siberian Russia, into the family of a theatre director from Fergana, Uzbekistan. His father, named Gavriil Abdulov was a wounded veteran of the Second World War decorated for his courage at the front-line tank battles against the Nazis. Abdulov's mother was a make-up artist at several Russian theatres. Young Abdulov grew up in Uzbekistan, where he finished high school and also became the Master of Sports in fencing. He was admitted to a local college where he had the chance of becoming a sports coach.  His dream of becoming an actor was almost ruined when he failed the admission tests at the Moscow State Institute of Theatrical Arts (GITIS). He could not go back to Uzbekistan so he stayed in various gloomy dorms in Moscow, working hard labor jobs at railway stations just to survive. He then studied acting at GITIS, made very little money working as an extra, and still was a hard laborer in order to pay for his living in Moscow. In 1975 he graduated from GITIS and was hired by the Lenkom Theatre director 'Mark Zakharov' (qv).  Abdulov revealed the full range of his talent in popular films _Obyknovennoye chudo (1978) (TV)_ (qv) and _S lyubimymi ne rasstavaytes (1979)_ (qv). The public adored Abdulov and he became the first big sex-symbol amidst the gloom of Soviet mass-zombification. Millions of his pictures has been decorating homes and student dorms in every big and small town of the former Soviet Union. His popularity made the Communist Party demand his performances at the Party Congresses, offering him such lines as \"We are entering communism\", but he refused to serve the Communist Party. Abdulov boldly turned down such offers twice. Then he suffered for several years from invisible interference with his work hurting his income, and his way of life. But the public still loved Abdulov - the actor and the man - for his sincere talent and for his devotion to his ideas.  Despite the political pressure threatening his film career during the 1970s and early 1980s, Aleksandr Abdulov made a strong comeback and gained even more popularity. He played his best roles under the direction of 'Mark Zakharov' (qv) in such films as 'Obyknovennoe Chudo (1978), 'Tot samyi Munchgausen (1979), 'Formula Lyubvi' (1984), and _Ubit drakona (1988)_ (qv). His best film partners were 'Oleg Yankovskiy' (qv), 'Evgeniy Leonov' (qv), 'Vyacheslav Tikhonov' (qv), 'Evgeni Evstigneev' (qv), 'Leonid Bronevoy' (qv), 'Andrey Mironov' (qv), 'Irina Kupchenko' (qv), 'Leonid Yarmolnik' (qv), 'Semyon Farada' (qv), 'Aleksandr Zbruev' (qv), 'Sergey Nikonenko' (qv), 'Irina Alfyorova' (qv) and others. This ensemble of fine actors and directors evolved into a special and uniquely Russian milieu, where Abdulov's multifaceted talent was supported by other actors.  His range and nuanced acting reached a new level in the films made in the late 1980s and 1990s. Abdulov created powerful roles in a tandem with the masterful 'Innokentiy Smoktunovskiy' (qv) in the innovative film 'Geniy' (1991) by director 'Viktor Sergeyev' (qv). At that time, Abdulov also received a Nika Award nomination for supporting role in _Sukiny deti (1990)_ (qv) by director 'Leonid Filatov (I)' (qv). Abdulov made two equally interesting works in collaboration with director 'Sergey Solovyov' (qv) in 'Chyornaya roza - emblema pechali, krasnaya roza - emblema lyubvi' (1989) and in 'Dom pod zvyozdnym nebom' (1991). Both works were awarded, acclaimed by critics, and loved by the public.  Abdulov showed his gift for transformation in the devilish character Korov'ev in 'Master i Margarita' (2005), a TV-series from director 'Vladimir Bortko' (qv) based on the eponymous book by 'Mikhail A. Bulgakov' (qv). Abdulov's energy helped the film making him the most lively nerve in the group of 'super stars' (some say super old stars). His acting became more classic and restrained in the traditionally Russian period-film 'Anna Karenina' (2005) based on the eponymous novel by 'Leo Tolstoy' (qv) from director 'Sergey Solovyov' (qv). Later Abdulov worked with director 'Aleksandr Buravskiy' (qv) in the epic film _Leningrad (2009)_ (qv), about the historic siege during the Second World War; where his acting partners were 'Gabriel Byrne' (qv), 'Mira Sorvino' (qv), 'Kirill Lavrov' (qv), 'Mikhail Efremov' (qv), 'Donatas Banionis' (qv) and other notable actors.  Aleksandr Abdulov was designated People's Artist of Russia. He received numerous awards and nominations for his performances in film and on stage. He was a permanent member of the troupe at Lenkom Theatre in Moscow. He also directed several films as well as stage productions. Aleksandr Abdulov died of lung cancer, on January 3, 2008, and was laid to rest in Vagankovskoe cemetery in Moscow, Russia.",Steve Shelokhonov

He studied the cello with Heinrich Werkmeister (1883 - 1936) at the Tokyo Music School (today's Music Department of Tokyo University of Fine Arts and Music), at the time the best facilities in Japan for studying Western music. Abe formed a chamber ensemble and worked on Beethoven's music in particular.  Abe played in the Music School's orchestra under conductor/composer Klaus Pringsheim who he admired. Pringsheim, appointed professor at the Tokyo Music School in 1931, had been a pupil of 'Gustav Mahler' (qv) and had conducted operas in Geneva, Prague and Bremen in the 1910s, and a cycle of Mahler's symphonies with the Berlin Philharmonic. Abe began to study German-style harmony and counterpoint with him, and decided he wanted to become a composer, not a cellist. Abe was strongly influenced by this teacher's view and knowledge of the late romanticism period represented by Mahler and 'Richard Strauss (I)' (qv), and neo-classicism by 'Paul Hindemith' (qv) and 'Kurt Weill' (qv).  At the age of 34 Abe had already written some works including several orchestral pieces, four string quartets, one flute sonata, choral pieces and film music, and had established his name as a master neo-classicist. In 1948 he was appointed music director of the imperial orchestra, a position he held for six years. The ensemble performed waltzes and serenades for guests from foreign countries at parties held by the Emperor. The members of the imperial orchestra however were originally musicians of Gagaku, performing Japanese ancient music. From them Abe learned Japanese traditional music, with which he was not very familiar in his younger days. It broadened the horizons of his compositional style.  Abe's works in the postwar days include Symphony No. 2 (1960), Clarinet Quintet (1946) and String Quartets Nos. 5-15 (1947-1993). He died at the age of 95 in Tokyo, in the morning of 28 December 2006.",Naxos.com

He failed his medical exam twice, and asked to be spared dishonor and allowed to pass the third time, under the agreement that he would never practice medicine, because he wanted to be a writer. In the 1960s he adapted his novels _Moetsukita chizu (1968)_ (qv), _The Box Man (2002)_ (qv), _Suna no onna (1964)_ (qv), and _Tanin no kao (1966)_ (qv) to film. The last proved unsuccessful, and the professional relationship they had dissolved. Abe's works did not shy away from the surreal or even elements of science fiction, and frequently dealt with medical doctors and medical terminology, even when becoming extremely Kafkaesque.

It has been a surreal journey for Taki Abe, who first set foot on Australian soil in the late nineties, as a naive 22 year old surfer who grew up in the popular beach town of Chigasaki, Japan. As an accomplished graphic design student, Abe's Australian surfing/ study holiday took an unexpected turn when he was cast as the lead role of 'Shark' in Australian Japanese Road Movie Bondi Tsunami, spotted by the Director whilst he was competing in a surf competition.  The unique 'music video' film Bondi Tsunami shot to popularity in Australia, after appearing in over 100 magazines, newspapers, radio and prime time TV shows; its cute Japanese cast and Zen philosophy highlighting Australia's love affair with all things Japanese. At the centre of all this attention, was rugged, handsome first time actor Taki Abe who charmed Australian audiences with his laid back attitude and chiseled good looks.  For the first time, Australian audiences had a Japanese sex symbol. Australians had not seen a Japanese guy in a movie with out his shirt on before, looking like a tanned confident and cool cowboy- Japanese were either cast as soldiers or dorky business men.  In Bondi Tsunami, Abe presents as an iconic westernized Japanese character in the way that he talks and moves, which is very appealing to both Japanese and western audiences alike.  Abe's exotic islander good looks, charming flirtatious personality and western sense of confidence sets him apart from other Japanese male actors of the day that can sometimes struggle to translate to a western audience.  In 2010 Abe played a Japanese POW role in Australian film \"Broken Sun\". The film which is set in 1944, tells the story of WW1 veteran Jack who meets an escaped Japanese POW on his farm in rural Australia.  With several new movie projects in the pipeline Taki Abe's popularity will continue to flourish.  With ever growing Australian interest in Japan, China and Asia across all industries, Abe's east/ west image is symbolic of Australia's modern identification with the Asia-Pacific region rather than traditional American or European affiliations.",Anonymous

4252,3301,19,"One of the genuine visionaries of Digital Computer Graphics and Visual Effects. From the early 1970s through the mid-80s, the Hollywood-based studio Robert Abel & Associates (RA&A) pushed the leading -- sometimes bleeding -- edge of visual effects. Working primarily in television advertising, (the only consistent market for such work at the time) RA&A created 33 Clio Award-winning commercials, including the dazzling 7Up \"Uncola\" spots and the influential CG \"Sexy Robot.\" This body of work, as noted by New York's Museum of Modern Art, \"changed television forever.\" Abel was primed for this path since his undergraduate studies at UCLA, where his mentor was the \"father\" of computer graphics, 'John Whitney Sr.' (qv). Working with an analog computer strapped to a camera, Abel happened accidentally upon a look that evolved into the 'slit scan' effect used in _2001: A Space Odyssey (1968)_ (qv). His friend 'Con Pederson' (qv), who pursued the technique in that film's famous 'stargate' sequence, would eventually become Abel's first partner. By the time the pair set up shop in 1971, Abel had become an Emmy Award-winning documentary filmmaker, with credits as varied as _Making of the President 1968 (1969) (TV)_ (qv) and _Mad Dogs & Englishmen (1971)_ (qv). The first visual effects job which the fledgling studio produced was the now-famous Whirlpool \"streak\" logo, which opened the door to assignments in TV graphics, commercials and films. Abel and Pederson were joined early on by 'Richard Taylor (III)' (qv), and the list of accomplished effects experts who worked at RA&A would grow over the years to include -- among many -- 'Richard Edlund' (qv), 'Richard E.

4280,3319,19,"A familiar character face in movies and television, Walter Abel was a dedicated stage actor who had studied at the prestigious American Academy of Dramatic Arts in New York before moving on to a progression of stage work that culminated in his first appearance on Broadway in the original play \"Forbidden\" in late 1919. The year before he had just dabbled in the relatively new film industry doing _Out of a Clear Sky (1918)_ (qv) directed by prolific silent actor and director 'Marshall Neilan' (qv). Abel did just one other silent and then moved back into serious stage work for ten years (including doing some road productions in 1924) before once again surfacing in film for the first sound version of the play _Liliom (1930)_ (qv). Perhaps he was enticed with doing the play on film, but his was a small part and the sound of early talkies - as usual - was lousy. Once again Abel returned to Broadway and worked steadily from late 1930 into part of the 1934 season. He would have some 40 Broadway roles in his career.  About that time his stage success was noticed by Hollywood, and he was signed with RKO. The studio had decided to do the first sound version of Alexander Dumas' The Three Musketeers (1935) which first appeared as a silent in 1922 with 'Douglas Fairbanks (I)' (qv). The part of the enthusiastic but novice D'Artagnan really called for a younger actor reflecting those traits, and RKO decided to go with Abel. He had a bright voice and an animated style of theater acting that seemed a good bet. It was all the more impressive considering Abel was in his mid 30s - but he looked younger. RKO did not skimp on the film. The director was Rowland Lee, who had just finished another Dumas filming, The Count of Monte Cristo (1934) with 'Robert Donat' (qv). The rousing music was composed by Max Steiner, and the costumes were gloriously rendered by Walter Plunkett.  Abel had a strong supporting cast in the three musketeers: 'Paul Lukas (I)' (qv), 'Moroni Olsen' (qv), and 'Onslow Stevens' (qv). Imposing European leading man Lukas and LA native Stevens had transitioned from silent films. This was Olsen's first movie, but he was a stage actor with his own acting troupe and some Broadway experience. As Porthos he had the opportunity to boom and bellow with hammy 19th century theatrics that fit the part. Abel's competence and an experienced cast showed in an enthusiastic rendition of the story with dueling set ups by first-time fencing choreographer 'Ralph Faulkner' (qv) that would be taken to heart by later productions. So those who have tended to hindsight this film as a pale forerunner of later versions really do it a contextual injustice.  The movie did well enough, and Abel moved among second tier RKO leads through 1938, while playing support to bigger names. But that is showbiz - obviously he was destined as a supporting actor, and he handled both comedy and drama with a self-assured style that kept him very busy through the 1940s. He was back on Broadway occasionally as well, with a last appearance in 1975. By 1949 he quickly embraced early TV playhouse productions and would appear in some 30 roles by 1960. He transitioned to being a familiar face on episodic TV along with a few more film roles through the 1960s and up to just a few years before his passing.",William McPeak

His first passion is cinematography to which he offers his services as a director/cinematographer.  He has completed two independent feature documentaries. In \"Shugendô Now\" he explores our relationship to nature through a Japanese tradition. In \"Diversidad\" he follows a group of young adults who embark on a journey to discover their relationship to the food they eat.  His niche is the creation of positive and heartfelt films that seek to share solutions to the fundamentals problems of our society. This comes from his conviction to play a part in the creation of a more ecological and just society. His quest will continue with his third film \"This is what Cooperation Looks Like\" where he will explore how coops allow for a much healthier business environment.  Jean-Marc has traveled around the world with his camera and through his explorations in film discovered a second passion in Permaculture, a science of sustainable design through the study of nature. He is gaining more experience as an educator and facilitator, giving workshops in video making and the Permaculture design process.

4463,3425,19,"An exciting, eclectic actor, Tim Abell is a man of his own making and when that making includes teaching ballroom dancing, horse training, writing, cooking, acting, producing and being a US Army Ranger with the 75th Ranger Regiment, you can see it is a formidable combination.  From the Maryland and Virginia area, as a young man Tim took up martial arts and boxing. He found a respect for wildlife conservation and a love for the land while hunting and fishing with his elders. At the age of 17 he joined the army, and owing to outstanding leadership skills, was promoted during basic training. He advanced quickly, attending AIT, Airborne School and Ranger School, all at Fort Benning, Georgia. He was assigned to the 2nd Ranger Battalion, Ft. Lewis, Washington, as a Ranger after enduring the Ranger Indoctrination Program (RIP).  Gaining further promotions, Tim also achieved a substantial number of awards due to his expertise in many varied fields. During his final year in the Army he served with the 3rd US Infantry, \"The Old Guard\", Caisson Platoon. Here he excelled as a horseman and played 'Robert E. Lee (II)' (qv) and 'Andrew Jackson (XI)' (qv), charging into battle on his trusty steed, in the US Army dramatic re-enactment of the History of the United States Torch Light Tattoo, at the Jefferson Memorial in Washington, DC, and a longer version called \"The Spirit of America\" performed in various places.  After five years of service Tim left the army to go to college. Once there he was encouraged to join the 'Arthur Murray (I)' (qv) Dance Studio and was soon teaching class to support himself through college. It was here that Tim first got involved with the theatre. Just short of graduating he took the decision to leave college and head to Los Angeles, where he took classes with 'Jeff Corey (I)' (qv) while searching for that all-important break.  Early on, after a series of low-budget films and many theatre projects, his break came, when 'April Webster' (qv) recommended that 'Jerry Bruckheimer' (qv) cast him in _Soldier of Fortune (1997) (TV)_ (qv) as Benny Ray Riddle, a former Marine scout/sniper recruited by the Pentagon to work as part of a covert team. The syndicated series ran for two seasons. Then followed a series of films that made much of Tim's military experiences, including _The Base (1999) (V)_ (qv), where he starred opposite 'Mark Dacascos' (qv) in a performance that had him compared to a young 'Willem Dafoe' (qv), and _The Substitute: Failure Is Not an Option (2001) (V)_ (qv) which also starred 'Treat Williams' (qv) and 'Bill Nunn' (qv).  Tim was to find himself starring with Dacascos again in the film adaptation of 'Lisa Gardner (I)' (qv)'s book \"The Perfect Husband\". In _Instinct to Kill (2001)_ (qv) Tim played psychotic killer Jim Beckett with 'Missy Crider' (qv) as his long-suffering wife.  _Murder, She Wrote: The Last Free Man (2001) (TV)_ (qv) for CBS, saw a change of direction for Tim into historical costume drama, which was then followed by roles alongside 'James Caan (I)' (qv) and 'Daniel Stern (I)' (qv) in 'Jason Bloom' (qv)'s award-winning \"Dead Simple\" a.k.a _Viva Las Nowhere (2001)_ (qv), and in the much acclaimed _We Were Soldiers (2002)_ (qv) starring 'Mel Gibson (I)' (qv). Guest-starring roles in the television series' _\"CSI: Miami\" (2002)_ (qv), _\"NCIS: Naval Criminal Investigative Service\" (2003)_ (qv) and _\"JAG\" (1995)_ (qv) bought Tim face to face with 'David Caruso (I)' (qv), 'Mark Harmon (I)' (qv) and 'David James Elliott' (qv).  In recent projects Tim has been behind the camera as well as in front of it. He was co-producer on the multi-award-winning film _Soldier of God (2005)_ (qv), directed by 'W.D. Hogan' (qv) and produced by 'Mir Bahmanyar' (qv). To date, \"Soldier of God\" has won Best Feature Film awards for 2005 at The Deep Ellum Film Festival in Dallas, The Stratford upon Avon International Film Festival in England and The Berkley Film Festival in California. As well as being co-producer on \"Soldier of God\", Tim took on the emotional intensity of portraying the eponymous anti-hero, Rene. It was a tour de force for this talented actor.  Tim also starred in and was associate producer on the 'Thadd Turner' (qv)-written _Miracle at Sage Creek (2005)_ (qv) starring 'David Carradine' (qv), 'Wes Studi' (qv), 'Michael Parks (I)' (qv) and 'Irene Bedard' (qv). Further films with Thadd Turner in 2006 will see Tim star alongside 'Shania Twain' (qv), 'Michael Madsen (I)' (qv) and 'Kris Kristofferson (I)' (qv) in _Buttermilk Sky (2007)_ and _Hard Ride, The (2007)_ .  He has recently finished filming \"The Tom Campbell Water Story\", a.k.a \"Breathe\", in Florida and Santa Barbara, California. The film, directed by and starring 'Don Murray (I)' (qv), is based on the true story of three scuba divers trapped in an underwater cave.",Rae Evans

He made his American stage debut in 1955 in a production of \"Stalag 17\" with 'Jason Robards' (qv) and 'Jules Munshin' (qv). Many plays in summer stock, regional and off-Broadway followed in a variety of theatrical offerings, from revues to Shakespeare (in a particularly low period, he worked as a magician's assistant for $10 a performance). In 1957 Ian was drafted into the army and stationed in Germany. He was in Special Services, where he directed the Continental premiere of \"Separate Tables\" and toured with 'Olivia de Havilland' (qv) in her show. Back in the US, Ian went to California for a backers' audition. That fizzled but he began his long and successful film and television career. For the past 40 years, his theatrical work highlights have included; \"As You Like It\", \"Hamlet\", \"Misalliance\", \"The Good Doctor\", \"The Way Of The World\", \"Mary Stuart\", \"Crucifer Of Blood\", \"Journey's End\", \"The Wrong Box\", \"The Cocktail Party\", \"Bert & Maisy\", \"Other Places\", \"Bent\", \"Natural Causes\", \"The Vortex\", \"Rough Crossing\", \"Africa\", \"Road & Lettice\" and \"Lovage\". He received awards for his work in \"Sweet Prince\" with 'Keir Dullea' (qv), \"Teeth N'smiles\", \"A Doll's House\" with 'Linda Purl' (qv) and \"The Arcata Promise\" opposite 'Anthony Hopkins (I)' (qv). He also received acclaim for the one-man show \"Jean Cocteau - A Mirror Image\". Recently a highlight was playing Alfie Doolittle in \"My Fair Lady\".

An original member of the Soul Train gang, Vicki along with other Soul Train dancers helped make Soul Train a hit with their style, personality, and dancing talents and became stars and legends themselves.  Vicki was every sense of the word fashion plate, she became a role model to young females of color who tuned in every Saturday to emulate her clothes style, style as a lady, and as a black beauty. Vicki was also a Soul Train eye candy favorite for the young men of her time. Her popularity gained her entry into popular black oriented magazines like Right On! where she modeled clothes and gave various interviews by popular demand. No other ladies were more lovelier and sweeter then Vicki Abercrombie on Soul Train and no lady filled Vicki's shoes after her tenure on Soul Train.

While viewers perceived Frankie as an angry, depressed, self-mutilating person, Frankie is actually a very happy person, when she's on her own terms.  The main problem with Frankie's stint on the _\"The Real World\" (1992)_ (qv) is that Frankie, who suffered from Cystic Fibrosis, has a very short life span expectation, and she felt that the experience was dragging her down and, in a sense, wasting her time, which is very precious for someone who will probably only live to 30, tops.  She left on Halloween of 2003, returning to Blue Springs where she dated her boyfriend, tattoo artist, Dave Duly.

His parents were against his singing but Abhijeet went against his parent's wishes to become a singer. In Kanpur his family members were all musical, and educated professionals. Money was never a contextual concern. In Kanpur education and culture was all his family courted, leisure was driving around the tree-lined lanes on bicycles. Confident and feted for his success, today the star-singer lives in a Bollywood dream bungalow (named Sunny vistas) of white façade and red-tiled roof.  He was the apple of the community eye for his singing talents and Pampered and cosseted by a fond family, Abhijeet was the youngest of four brothers. He came to Mumbai in 1981 to study Chartered Accountancy. But owing to his fascination for singing and music he decided to pursue a career in playback singing. Despite being gifted with a melodious voice, he had to struggle for a very long time.  During his struggle period due to economic constraints Abhijeet had to reside in tiny rooms and stingy guesthouses. He returned to Kanpur but each time was drawn to the magnetism of Mumbai with a dream to be fulfilled. He was packing his bags after a long struggle in Bombay when he received a call from R.D. Burman to sing for Dev Anands son's debut film. Abhijeet also got to sing with Kishore Kumar, his idol, in the same film. It all happened to Abhijeet as he received a new lease of life when music director Ravindra Jain, gave him an offer to live with him. It was during his stay with Ravindra that Abhijeet's proximity to Bollywood grew in a phased and gradual manner. He began visiting R.D. Burman's residence and started getting frequent opportunities to sing for stage shows. Abhijeet got opportunities to sing as a chorus singer for music directors Rajesh Roshan and Jagjit Singh.  It was R.D. Burman who acted like a mentor to Abhijeet and gave him his first break as a playback singer in Dev Anand's Anand Aur Anand. The song was 'Waadon ki shaam aayi, yaaron ke naam aayi'. But the film flopped and he was struggling to find work again. For quite a few years after that he resorted to singing cover versions of Kishore Kumar hits.  In the 1990s he got his due rewards when the songs of Baaghi of Anand-Milind, 'Ek chanchal shokh hasina', 'Chandni raat hai' and 'Har kasam se badi hai' were Superhits. Today Abhijeet is one of the top names when it comes to male playback singers. He has entrenched himself firmly in the music world, with several other hits like 'Ole Ole' in Yeh Dillagi, the title track of Main Khiladi Tu Anari, 'Zara sa Jhoom loo main' Dilwale Dulhaniya Le Jaayenge 'Teri ankhen jhuki jhuki' Fareb, 'Shaher Ki ladki' Rakshak, 'Jhanjhriya' Krishna, 'Tan tana tan tan tara' Judwaa. Be it a Sunil Shetty, Anil Kapoor, Akshay Kumar, Saif Ali Khan, or Salman Khan, Shahrukh Khan and now Hrithik Roshan, Abhijeet has sung for them all. He performed for many films like Baaghi, Sadak, Khiladi, Raja Babu, Yeh Dillagi, Yes Boss, Baadshah, Josh and Dhadkan and many more. After his success in playback singing he thought of singing pop. He launched two albums, Main Deewana Hoon and Tapori No. 1. But both albums did not click commercially. After these two pop albums, he launched Aashiqui, which was appreciated by audience. Recently he has launched a pop album, Tere Bina, whose songs and video are chartbusters.  He won the Filmfare Award and Screen Award for the best singer for his song 'Main Koi Aisa Geet Gaoon' in Yes Boss. He also won the MTV ASIA Award 2004. After that singing with most of the big banner movies and top music composers, the singer has once again hit the top charts.",amioDgreat

From her birth itself she had hearing and speech impairments even then she has been acting in various advertisements since her childhood. Thanks to years of therapy and training, she partially overcame her speech and hearing impairments.  Her interest towards both modelling and acting at a very young age was well noticed and encouraged by her father. Eventually, at the age of 17 she entered into the film industry making her acting debut in Naadodigal (2009), a Malayalam movie and went on to reprise the role in its Telugu and Kannada remakes.  Since her adolescence, Abhinaya had mastered sign language and lip reading in English. She had also undergone a risky operation (Cochlear Implantation) that had helped her hear with the help of a machine. She would write her script dialogues in English and practice with the help of her mother. Co-artistes would also keep communicating with her guiding and helping her. The collective efforts of the directors, her parents and Abhinaya's determination ensured that the teenager did most of her parts without retakes.  Abhinaya , who loves pets and Sudoku, has discontinued her studies at Std X to focus on her career. Actress Abhinaya's Father worked in Tamil and Telugu films as a minor artist in few supporting roles. So she made her interest like her father. Her photo session in model well gathered the attention of directors especially by the South Indian Actor cum choreographer Lawrence Ragavendra.  She acted in various Television programs and advertisements which eventually resulted in superior facial expressions. Abhinaya's dancing skills were highly impressive and attention-seeking. One day, Director Samudrakani gave her a chance in the film \"Nadodikal\" after appreciating her photo session and her dancing skills. Being highly determined and hopeful Abhinaya stunned everyone with her amazing acting skills even though her voice was being dubbed.  After this film's success she well started settling in the Tamil Industry and eventually into Telugu and Kannada film industries after getting various offers. Telugu Film Actor, Ravi Teja stood as another inspiration in her life apart from her father who morally supported her acting. Though she was physically challenged, she literally posed a challenge against various young actors of her age with her impressive acting skills.",Srinivas

After graduating High School, Donat moved to Miami where he networked and continued to see the world as a free for all opportunity. Having made friends from the high class ranks, Donat learned how to become more social, and evolve himself in which to create a way to live. Living the life you desire.  In the summer of 2009, Donat relocated to Los Angeles, where he attended Los Angeles Community College in pursuit of a business degree, and also to develop his artistic abilities as an actor. After spending 2 years in Los Angeles, Donat realized the importance of business, and decided to live with family in New York City.

English born Abigail was educated in France. Her mother was a Ceylonese (Sri Lankan) of Dutch Burgher/Eurasian ethnicity. Abigail came to Australia in 1971 and played female lead in \"There's a Girl in My Soup\" in Perth. Moved to Sydney and got noticed in a TV commercial in which she played a Marilyn Monroe type bombshell opposite 'Phil Silvers' (qv). Landed the role of Bev in Number 96. Was an original cast member and one of the most popular stars of the series, though Abigail quickly tired of the monotonous storylines for Bev (she was a shy virgin and the scriptwriters conspired to simply throw her into bed with a series of men) and after several public disagreements with the show's producers left suddenly in June 1973. The role of Bev was hastily recast, with the new actress taking over mid-episode. Abigail was the only major star of the series not to appear in the movie version released in 1974. Abigail had difficulty gaining many serious roles after leaving the series, and appeared in several bit-parts closely following the contours of her sex-symbol image in various sex-comedy films of the mid 1970s. Later appeared in several comedy roles on the stage, played a prim French teacher in school based drama _\"Class of '74\" (1974)_ (qv) and a super-efficient secretary in the early episodes of hospital soap _\"The Young Doctors\" (1976)_ (qv). Was finally lured back to Number 96 in 1976 briefly playing a new character called Eve who was to appear in a proposed spin-off series with 'Elaine Lee (I)' (qv) though the new series was never picked-up. Retired from acting and lived on a banana plantation in Queensland. Publicly criticized the increasingly overt sex-scenes and violence featured in the later episodes of Number 96. In 1984 after a long absence from the limelight was cast as comic heroine Caroline Morrell in television soap _\"Sons and Daughters\" (1982)_ (qv) by producers desperate to revamp the show after the departure of the series most famous character Patricia \"Pat the Rat\" Hamilton portrayed by 'Rowena Wallace' (qv). Abigail's character was a great success and the show survived a further three years with Caroline quickly becoming one of the central characters. She continued with the series until its demise in 1987. Later appeared in guest roles on TV shows such as the long-running series _\"Neighbours\" (1985)_ (qv), and was added to the cast of floundering series _\"Chances\" (1991)_ (qv) in a last ditch attempt to spice up its quickly fading popularity. In return to her sex-comedy roots, Abigail's Chances character was a sex-therapist named Bambi Chute.",Anonymous

Before his American debut in 2006's Civic Duty (2006) in which he gave an outstanding & compelling performance & very convincing portrayal of a very difficult character of Gabe Hassan, he made numerous films in his native Egypt. Here is how it all began ...  Since his first major public appearance as a TV late night show host in 1999, It was only a matter of few roles and He became an Award winning star in Egypt and the Arab world, His background is as versatile as it can get, No wonder he's been nicknamed Superman!  He studied Tele-communication Engineering and graduated with honours from Ain Shams University, one of the most prestigous Engineering schools in Egypt, meanwhile Water polo as his hobby grew fast to become almost a profession when he teamed up with Egypt's Water polo National team as its Goal Keeper, But it was his other passion of acting & singing at the Theatre Department of The American University in Cairo that grew with him gradually to become his chosen final career.  Exchange of hobbies and professions happened several times to Khaled. First when Water polo became the main focus for him 1986-1989, then Spacecrafts! and Tele-Communications while researching it at The University of Surrey, UK in 1991, while playing Water polo for his varsity team in European tournaments where He started a parallel career of Fashion Catwalk Modeling back then.  In 1999 another switch happened when he (as a famous young face & well established catwalk model in Egypt) was offered by chance! to Host a TV program at Nile Varity Channel as a part of a new TV pan-Arab Network inaugurated by state owned ERTU in Egypt. He became the talk of the town with his new fresh style and controversial ways. He hosted and interviewed all kinds of stars - Arab and international. Khaled left Nile Variety channel October 2000, joined MBC TV Network in June 2001.  In the year 2000 He was chosen by News Dept. (Ch: 1 in Egypt TV) as a result of winning the title of \"Best New Announcer\"; to present, \"Good Morning Egypt\", one of the most widely known programs in Egypt, and continued presenting it till end of 2001: The time for a major switch: he finally got his first acting break with offers of lead roles in movies in Egypt that started being released in Egypt and The Arab world.  In just a few years he collected more than 8 Best Actor Awards from National and International Film festivals & events. The latest is winning the Best Actor Award from Alexandria International Film festival 2006 for his role Essam in Leabet el hob (2006)  Naga is known for his travels with his movies around the globe.

5386,4135,19,"Dr. Andre Aboolian is an accomplished Beverly Hills Board certified plastic surgeon specializing in aesthetic/cosmetic plastic surgery, liposuction, contouring as well as skin rejuvenation procedures and programs. A firm believer in taking advantage of the most advanced technologies and proven surgical advances, Dr. Aboolian skillfully utilizes the latest innovations. Men and women come from all over the country and the world to become patients of Dr. Aboolian. In addition to traditional plastic surgeries such as rhinoplasty (nose jobs) and breast augmentation, the doctor's expertise in body lift, arm lift, buttock lift and thigh lift procedures has led to him being referred to as the \"body expert\" by colleagues. These procedures are used to tighten loose skin and lift the specific body parts that sag with normal aging or significant weight loss.  Dr. Aboolian has been called upon to make regular appearances on ABC's \"Extreme Makeover\" and has been featured on such shows as \"Access Hollywood,\" \"iVillage Live,\" and others. His surgical skills and expert judgment are also sought after by a large international clientele, including celebrities and business executives. However, it is his sensitivity and natural connection with people that truly set him apart; he has the capacity to translate a person's desires into customized treatment, therefore facilitating a transformation of the mind as well as the body.  One of the doctor's most noted successes is Erik Chopin, who went from 400 lbs. to 193 lbs. to become \"The Biggest Loser\" on the NBC show of the same name. After meeting with numerous surgeons in the New York area where he lives, Erik chose to come to Los Angeles for a full body lift because he was so impressed with Dr. Aboolian and the results of similar surgeries he has performed. Dr. Aboolian not only has an abundance of impressive before and after photographs (he recommends that prospective patients see many not just one or two), he is also adamant about proper preparation for weight reduction surgeries. He requires that patients reach their optimum weight and train with an appropriate fitness trainer so they are in the best possible physical condition and learn to maintain a positive lifestyle. He will only operate on patients who achieve these goals so that the surgery will be a one time solution, not a band aid.  Dr. Aboolian completed his undergraduate education at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) where he received the Los Angeles Medical Center Auxiliary Award in 1989. The previous year he received the American Heart Association of Southern California Research Award. For medical school and General Surgery residency he attended the Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York. His Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery residency was completed at the renowned MD Anderson Cancer Center at The University of Texas.  Dr. Aboolian is an Associate Fellow of the American College of Surgeons and is a member of the American Society of Plastic Surgeons (ASPS), California Society of Plastic Surgeons (CSPS), Los Angeles Society of Plastic Surgeons (LASPS) and California Medical Association (LASPS) and California Medical Association (CMA).",Jo-Ann Geffen

Carolyn became a founding editor of her high school newspaper and went on to study journalism at Carleton Universiy in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada from 1987-1991. She received a Bachelor of Journalism in Journalism, Political Science and History. During that time, she held summer reporting stints at the Welland Tribune, the TorontoStar and worked the peaceful night desk at the Ottawa Citizen, covering murders fires and car crashes. After graduation, 'Carolyn Abraham' (qv) set off to travel and freelance in south Asia, where she caught memorable glimpses of her ancestral homeland in India, as well as dysentery and a mountain river parasite in central Nepal. Returning home to a full-time job at the Ottawa Citizen, she discovered her passion for long-form writing. Her work earned the Edward Goff Penny Memorial Prize for Young Canadian Journalists for two consecutive years. In 1996, after making the natural move from crime to politics, Carolyn landed in Toronto at Queen's Park. Two years later she joined the Globe and Mail as a medical reporter. Dolly, the famous Dorset sheep and first mammalian clone, was a newborn, and the Human Genome Project was about to produce its first map. She was nominated for six NNA's (National Newspaper Awards) and two awards for features related to the controversies in diagnosing bipolar disorder in children and The Globe's special project on cancer. She is a four-time recipient of the (CSWA's) Canadian Science Writers Association Science in Society Award for her medical reporting. Carolyn worked as a reporter for The Ottawa Citizen covering general news, crime features and provincial politics at Queen's Park from 1991 to 1997. Abraham worked as a medical reporter and feature writer for The Globe and Mail from February 1998 to January 2012. She received the Hollobon Science in Society Award for her articles on the business of genetics. Carolyn wrote the book, Possessing Genius: The Bizarre Odyssey of Einstein's Brian, detailing the true story behind the man who took Einstein's brain in 2002. The book was published in four languages and distributed in seven countries earning her a nomination for the 2002 Governor's General's Award for Literary Non-Fiction and winner of the Canadian Science Writers Association National Book Award. She wrote the chapter on the outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome in Canada for the World Health Organization. She recently wrote the series, \"The DNA Dilemma\" for The Globe And Mail. Her latest book, The Juggler's Children: a Journey into Family, Legend and the Genes that Bind Us, a memoir to be published by Random House in March 26, 2013 that explores the power of DNA testing to solve family mysteries.

His father Abraham John is a Syrian Christian (Nasrani/Nazrani) from Aluva, Kerala, India and his mother Firoza Irani is a Zoroastrian Parsi from India's Parsi community. His father is an architect and his mother is a homemaker and charity worker. He has a younger brother named Alan Abraham. John's Parsi name given to him by his mother's family is Farhan. Being a Syrian Christian from Kerala, his father gave him John, a biblical name, as his first name and Abraham as his last name from the Nasrani naming system by receiving the father's first name as a last name. A Syrian Christian person from Kerala receives their surname from their paternal grandfather, father, or family house.  John studied at Bombay Scottish School, Mahim in Mumbai. He got his bachelor's degree in honors economics from Jai Hind College and got his MBA from Narsee Monjee Institute of Management Studies, Mumbai. John also received an MMS from Mumbai Educational Trust (MET). As a student, he was just a bit above average, and was always in the top 15 in his class. He was the captain of his football team at Jai Hind College. He also ran track at Bombay Scottish School, where he was a champion in the 100 and 200 meter dashes. John trained in Tae Kwon Do under master Javed Khan.  After college, he worked in media at Time & Space Media Entertainment Promotions Ltd and Enterprise Nexus. His big break came when he entered the Gladrags Manhunt competition in March of 1999. He almost missed the deadline, but luckily, he was allowed in. John won Gladrags Manhunt and went on to compete for Gladrags Manhunt International in the Philippines, where he finished first runner-up. After that, he began working on many modeling assignments. He got signed by Cary Models in Singapore and did a fair amount of work there, and later in Hong Kong, London, and New York.  With a name like John Abraham, it gave him a noted stand when he entered the modeling field. His revolutionary looks, macho body, baby smiles, and nice character made him the highest-paid supermodel in India. Being a hot star in the modeling world, he made his film debut in 2003. Not like usual Bollywood heroes who debut in male-oriented action features, he accepted the erotic and emotional _Jism (2003)_ (qv). Unfortunately the film did not do well, but his work was noticed widely. Later the same year came the paranormal _Saaya (2003)_ (qv) and romantic _Paap (2003)_ (qv), neither of which did well at the box office.  His first blockbuster smash hit came in the year 2004 when he played the antihero Kabir in _Dhoom (2004)_ (qv).",The Old Fox {by_oldfox@yahoo.com}

In 2008 Taylor achieved a Top 40 standing on Canadian Idol, and was seen in over three million households each week. The same year, he also recorded 26 episodes in the leading role of Luis Calabasas in the Daytime-Emmy Nominated cartoon series _\"The Future Is Wild\" (2007)_ (qv) (A Nelvana Production). Presently, he is voicing the leading character Yuki in Beyblade: Metal Masters, while helping to write a musical, playing gigs, and taking his final credits for a music major at York University in vocal/free improvisation.  After spending years working on his songwriting, music free-improvising, performing, and shamelessly self-promoting (primarily on Youtube), Taylor gathered a good following from over 150 original acting & music videos. This got him the attention of multiple-Juno winning producer/drummer Michael Wojewoeda (Rheostatics), who will produce his next album. Taylor has written & recorded two triple albums independently, along with other music projects, and an audio podcast, all which can be found at www.taylorabrahamse.ca. He was nominated for 'Best Young Songwriter' at the Toronto Independent Music Awards, and won the same title at the Songwriters Association Of Canada's 'SongStudio'. His voice & guitar abilities, particularly while free-improvising original 'organic sampling' compositions, continue to wow audiences.  As a child, Taylor was best recognized for playing Elliot in three seasons of the TV Series _\"Doc\" (2001-2004)_(with 'Billy Ray Cyrus' (qv)). On the set, he met and worked on a few episodes with 'Miley Cyrus' (qv), her first acting role. He was nominated for a Young Artist Award for his performance in the episode 'Man's Best Friend'. During this time, he was also hand-picked by Jimmy Osmond to play a younger version of himself in the ABC biopic 'Inside The Osmonds', which inspired him to record an EP which included music by the Mormon musical family, and original work.  As a teenager, Taylor was also well-received while playing Cinco, the youngest member of the Group of Seven in 'Snow White And The Group Of Seven', starring opposite of rock veteran 'Alan Frew' (qv) (Glass Tigger), Canadian Idol finalists 'Ryan Malcolm' (qv), Elena Juatco, 'Gary Beals' (qv), and 'Billy Klippert' (qv), and also comedians 'Sean Cullen (I)' (qv) and 'Ross Petty' (qv) in the family musical. This Ross Petty Production played at Toronto's 1,500 seat Elgin Theatre from November 30th of 2005 to January 8th of 2006. Other noteable theatre credits include playing the blind lead of Don Baker in a production of 'Butterflies Are Free'. In addition, Taylor made many short films/music recordings during this theatrical period, while taking classes at PCVS.",Anonymous

6115,4729,19,"Zack Abramowitz was born Zachary Scott Abramowitz in Brooklyn, New York in 1983. As a teenager he attended James Madison High School and started acting in school productions. Attending CUNY Hunter in Manhattan to study Theater, he trained under Bill Walters, Mira Felner and Barbara Bosch, performing in plays such as The Pillowman. During his time at Hunter he also became a consummate student and performer of improvisation at Chicago City Limits and the Upright Citizens Brigade. Even more significant in 2003 was his introduction to the Caymichael Patten Studio. There, under the tutelage and strong leadership of Caymichael Patten, Elyse Knight, and Heather Loschiavo he became an avid student, honing his craft and gaining experience in all facets of acting, both artistically and on the business end as well.  From this Zack branched off into independent productions both in the theater and on film. Whether it's abstract theater (4.48 Psychosis), improv comedy (The Art of the Pick-up), surrealism (Harold Maxx) or science fiction (Amazing Fantasy), he has attempted various styles of drama and comedy on both stage and screen. In 2005 he went as part of a traveling theater group with CUNY to China and performed A Dream Play for the Beijing Academy of Drama in front of an audience of a thousand people to much acclaim. After graduating in 2005, Zack continued with film and theater work such as Guardians, a blistering attack on torture, in which he plays one of two leads performing monologues, to the film comedy How to Lose in the Game of Life. To date, he has performed in several prestigious NYC theaters such as Primary Stages, Manhattan Theatre Source, Dramatist's Guild, the Flea, the Magnet, Upright Citizen's Brigade, and the Danny Kaye Playhouse. He has trained with various Casting Directors in NYC such as Paul Schnee of Barden/Schnee Casting, Alaine Alldaffer of Playwrights Horizons, Marci Phillips of ABC and Katja Blichfeld of NBC.  In 2007 Zack made his web-series debut with Zack and Michael. Not only did he create and star in this show, but he was also writer, director, and producer. Previously he had written and directed a short film while at CUNY, but for this his ambitions were rewarded. 13 episodes chronicle the \"saga\" of two aspiring actors, Zack and Michael of the title, and try to break into the industry by way of a reality show filming their every crazy move. The pilot episode, a Star Wars fan film parody, screened at both the Pilot Lite and Big Apple Con Film Festivals in 2008, and the videos have garnered tens of thousands of views on YouTube since.  Recently Zack has also directed, produced and starred in a short documentary on The Dark Knight, a tribute with interviews of fans on Halloween night in 2008 on the streets of New York, co-starred in another comedic web-series coming soon titled Losers (which he also writes for), and can soon be seen in the upcoming feature films The Bastard Men of Root Flats, a steampunk western, and the dark comedy The Mel Klein Diaries. Zack looks forward to continually working with inspired people on inspired projects.",Jack Christal

The product of mostly single sex education at The Brearley School in Manhattan, Abiola's first foray into media was as a member of a feminist rap and slam poetry group when she was 15. The group named Females Beyond Control drew praise from other young people in her community but extreme criticism from her headmistress. The powers that be at Sarah Lawrence College were more encouraging however and Abiola quickly found herself writing and directing theatrical projects. Her first successful project as a professional media-maker was as producer-writer of Off-Off-Broadway hit Goddess City when she was only in her early 20s.  Spurred into action after 9-11-01, Abiola became a full time director. In 2004, she and her family lost 2 of her mother's sisters unexpectedly to cancer within a 6 month period. This led her to realize that she could no longer wait to launch the empowerment movement that she envisioned for women and The Goddess Factory was born. Appropriately, her talent has not only been recognized by Ms. Magazine, but by Cosmo as well. Currently Abiola is curating the Until The Violence Stops Film Festival for theater activist Eve Ensler and directing a feminist hip hop film produced by Candida Royalle.",Anonymous

6192,2701974,19,"Alan Abrams was born to Dr. and Mrs. Steven Abrams in Hollywood, California. He grew up in nearby Brentwood, where he attended Brentwood Elementary, famous for having scenes from several movies, such as The Next Best Thing (starring Rupert Everett and Madonna). Abrams attended Paul Revere Junior High for a semester and then transferred to Theodore Herzl Jewish Academy, where he attended for grades 7 through 9. He then attended Fairfax High School and got his GED in 1979, shortly after the start of his senior year. In 1985, while in Texas on vacation, Alan met Sheana Cosper, a pretty, divorced, single mother. They got married later that year. In 1992, Zachary Michael and Dylan Anthony were born. The Abrams family moved to Colorado in 1994, after the earthquake. Shortly before, in June, Sheana and Alan found out that they were pregnant with their third child, Tyler Jacob, who was born in February 1995, exactly one month before the due date. In 1996, the Abrams family moved to Coral Springs, Florida and then moved again in October 2002 to Phoenix, Arizona.  Eleven years later, in mid-2006, Alan was playing golf with a former baseball player friend of his, Ferguson Jenkins, who, after Alan explained a bunch of strange rules on how he plays golf, told Alan he should make it into a TV series. A couple days later, after telling Sheana and making her laugh harder than she had in a long time, Alan called his friend Steve Scarsone, another former ballplayer, who agreed to be his production partner. A week later or so, Alan and Steve, along with Alan's son Zac, and an editor/cinematographer named Webb Pickersgill, met at a restaurant and discussed \"The Weekenders Golf Tour\", a new concept in reality game-show programming. Abrams, with the help of his son, Zac, created a web page and a MySpace profile, which each received a combined number of 70,000 hits within three days. The pilot was shot on September 11, 2006 and aired locally in Phoenix on January 7, 2007.  Alan and Sheana currently reside in Phoenix, Arizona, where they live with their four kids: Sara Olivia, Zachary Michael, Dylan Anthony, and Tyler Jacob.",Anonymous

His first summer job was as the Assistant Drama Director at Cedar Lake sleep-away camp.  He then went to the University of Michigan (Ann Arbor) and graduated from the honors program with a BA in Psychology.  In 1995, Dan was accepted into the inaugural year of the T-2000 program at Turner Entertainment in Atlanta. He enjoyed unprecedented access to high- ranking executives and fantastic opportunities to explore different facets of the industry. Concurrently, he joined \"Whole World Theater\" as a collaborator and Producer (assisting in the development of subsequent television projects).  In 1997, E! Entertainment Television hired Dan as an Associate Producer on a new biography series that would come to be known as _\"E! Mysteries & Scandals\" (1998)_ (qv). He was soon after promoted to Writer-Producer and produced the highly rated 'Lenny Bruce' (qv) & 'Orson Welles' (qv) episodes.  Dan went on to assorted producer positions on documentaries, reality shows, game shows and talk shows.  His skills at the poker tables lead to him producing the \"2000 World Series of Poker\" for the Discovery Channel. This was widely recognized as being groundbreaking. He was the first to introduce running statistics to show who was in the lead and further present the game as a spectator sport.  Dan wrote and directed a play entitled \"Corpania\" at the 'Stella Adler' (qv) Theater. He also wrote and directed a pilot-presentation entitled \"The R.A.s\" at the HBO-Warner Bros. Television Workspace.  Currently, Dan produces non-fiction television. But in his spare time, he writes scripts and performs stand-up comedy at The Improv with \"The Heavy Hitters of Comedy\".",Dan Abrams

He was born Andrei Lvovich Abrikosov on November 14, 1906, in Simferopol, Crimean province, Russian Empire (now Simferopol, Crimea, Ukraine). His father, Lew Abrikosov, was an agricultural technician, and his mother was a homemaker. Young Abrikosov left his parents' home as a teenager, and wandered all over Russia for several years, until he finally came to Moscow in 1925, at the age of 18. His first job was a metal worker at a Moscow industry, albeit he had a dream to become an actor, as he was fascinated by the silent movies.  In the summer of 1925 Abrikosov entered the acting studio of 'Aleksandra Khokhlova' (qv), but soon moved to the acting class of Z.S. Sokolova, the sister of 'Konstantin Stanislavski' (qv). In 1926 Abrikosov joined the troupe of the Maly Theatre, but directors did not give him any roles to play for the next five years. However, in 1930 he was cast by directors 'Olga Preobrazhenskaya' (qv) and 'Ivan Pravov' (qv) as the main lead in the silent movie _Tikhiy Don (1931)_ (aka.. The Cossacks of the Don, or 'And Quiet Flows the Don') which was the first film adaptation of the eponymous novel by 'Mikhail Sholokhov' (qv). The film became popular in Russia and internationally, and Abrikosov became and instant celebrity.  Andrei Abrikosov co-starred opposite 'Nikolai Cherkasov' (qv) in the classic film _Aleksandr Nevskiy (1938)_ (qv) by director 'Sergei M. Eisenstein' (qv), and played supporting roles in both parts of 'Ivan the Terrible'. He was awarded the State Stalin's Prize (1941) and was designated People's Actor of Russia (1952) and People's Actor of the USSR (1968). During the 1930s he was a member of the troupe with the Moscow Chamber Theatre under directorship of 'Alexander Tairov' (qv). From 1938 to 1973 Abrikosov was a permanent member of the troupe at the Vakhtangov Theatre, and from 1953-1959 he was artistic director of the Vakhtangov Theatre in Moscow.  During the peak of their acting career, in the 1950s and 1960s, Andrei Abrikosov performed together with his son, 'Grigori Abrikosov' (qv). They enjoyed much success, which brought the attendant pressure, and both developed addiction to alcohol. Both father and son Abrikosovs were notorious in Moscow for their frequent stage appearances after and between their routine drinks, and acting under the influence. However, their performances were usually so good that both were able to get away with alcohol abuse at work. Some performances by the father and son Abrikosovs under the influence were described in famous jokes about their ability to improvise on stage when they were drunk and completely forgot their lines, so they borrowed random phrases from several other plays and were able to get away with it brilliantly, often leaving the public amazed with their improvisations.  Andrei Abrikosov died on October 21, 1973, and was laid to rest in Novodevichy Cemetery in Moscow, Russia.",Steve Shelokhonov

He was born Grigori Lvovich Abrikosov on August 30, 1932, in Moscow, Russia, USSR. His father, Lev Abrikosov, was a notable Russian actor. Young Grigori Abrikosov was brought up in the artistic environment of his father's circle; he was so impressed with the personality of his father, that no other influences could change his choice to follow his father's steps. From 1949 - 1954 he studied acting at the Shchukin Theatrical School of the Vakhtangov Theatre in Moscow, where his father was artistic director. In 1954, he graduated as an actor, and joined his father on stage and in film.  From 1954 - 1993 Grigori Abrikosov was a permanent member of the troupe at Vakhtangov Theatre. There he played leading and supporting roles in stage productions of such classic plays as 'Talanty i poklonniki' (aka.. Talents and admirers) by 'Aleksandr Ostrovsky', a production that was later made into a film adaptation by director Isidor Annensky with the music by 'Tikhon Khrennikov' (qv). Abrikosov's best known role in film was Gritsian in _Svadba v Malinovke (1967)_ (qv) a popular musical comedy by director 'Andrei Tutyshkin' (qv).  During the peak of their acting career, in the 1950s and 1960s, Abrikosov's success brought the attendant pressure, and he developed addiction to alcohol. Both father and son Abrikosovs were notorious in Moscow for their frequent stage appearances after and between their routine drinks, and acting under the influence.

After the death of his famous father, Grigori Abrikosov fell into depression and became an alcoholic. Although he was largely ignored by the new generation of filmmakers, he continued working with the Vakhtangov Theatre, and his stage acting remained strong, albeit he played only one role, appearing as doctor in a popular comedy 'Be well'. He was designated People's Actor of Russia (1983). He died of a heart failure on April 13, 1993, and was laid to rest in Novodevichy Cemetery in Moscow, Russia.",Steve Shelokhonov

Growing up in an art-loving family, Naser developed a high sense of music and rhythm since the age of 3, drumming and singing at all times and places, especially on his school desk. In 1992, Naser started learning how to play the Piano and gradually took classes learning several musical instruments until he found his real passion in 1996, the guitar. His unique talent allowed him to excel at playing classic guitar in short time, encouraging him to continue his music education to acoustic, electric, flamenco and other kinds of guitars. Starting 2001, Naser's unique talent, passion and fast growing reputation got him several offers to join working local bands. For 5 years, he joined several bands where he played the lead guitarist covering a vast range of music genres, such as classic, rock, Jazz and Funk. In addition, Naser was one of the main organizers and hosts of concerts held in Jordan and Lebanon at several scales. Early 2005, Naser joined the School of Audio Engineering (SAE) in Amman and graduated with an Audio Engineering Diploma in 2007, and a professional training in main advanced audio softwares. Developing from there, Naser composed and produced two albums with his new band \"Jumping Turtle\" called We are Not Here & The Wrong Revolution which are soon lined up for music video production. Inclined to better practice and to produce International music, Naser relocated to Canada to continue his training in film scoring while he studies Professional Sound Production at the Metalworks Institute. August 2010, Naser landed his debut film scoring job for \"Love...Older\", shot in Los Angeles and Beirut, where he successfully composed Arabic, Japanese and American music for award winning filmmakers.",Mike Chaanine

Majoring in Film/TV and Minoring in journalism and theater at the Lebanese American University in Beirut, Zaid Graduated in 2005 with a BA in Communication Arts.

Between 2004 and 2006, he worked all over the world as a freelance Assistant Director, Line producer, and for a while, a dancer. In 2006, Zaid served as the first Assistant Director/writer for the Jordanian Version of Sesame Street New York, confirming his love of directing children in the arts.

His father was an officer in the Army, so he spent his life moving from place to place across the United States, and even Europe as an army brat. Accustomed to change as he was, something that was constant in his life has been movies. As Angel grew older, his passion for film only grew greater as he learned more about the process of filmmaking, or \"magic process,\" by watching \"Movie Magic\" and other behind-the-scenes programs. He wanted to create aliens and monsters or be one of those guys who blew stuff up. When he was a sophomore in high school, he wanted to go to the root of filmmaking and become a screenwriter. Ultimately, Angel attended Hofstra University to become a film director and earned a Bachelor's degree in Film Studies and Production. He graduated with four short films under his belt, an award for Best Screenplay for his senior thesis, \"Cheesecake,\" and an award for \"Most Outstanding Film Department Senior.\" He is also a co-founder of Ragtag Productions.",Debbie Roth

Realizing his hobby of movies could actually become a career path, Stuart went on to direct, produce, and edit a feature film, shot on video, as a senior in high school. Stuart graduated Boston University where he directed several short films. After attending the 1999 Sundance film festival, his latest film entitled _Bobby Loves Mangos (1998)_ (qv) earned the accolade of film critic Roger Ebert as well as many throughout the Hollywood film industry. Stuart signed a distribution deal for \"Bobby Loves Mangos\" with Atomfilms, and his film has been sold to various companies including The Sci-Fi Channel, HBO, and United Airlines. Currently, Stuart is represented by The Writers & Artists Agency. Stuart has penned several screenplays, and is the process of securing financing for his first feature film. Stuart also directs commercials for clients such as Phillips, Porsche, and his most notable spot \"Super Absorbant\", which was featured in Fox's \"the best commercials you'll never see\" segment starring supermodel Shalom Harlow (Currently the new GAP girl).  As mentioned in recent press, Stuart has also completed his very first music video for the band \"Powder\" that was recently picked up on MTV, marking the first spec music video in history to air on the network. The video was also recently voted #1 on the Much Music Network. The project stars Jay Mewes (Jay and Silent Bob, Clerks, Dogma), and Ahmet Zappa. As a result, Stuart has joined the roster of well-respected Commercial Production House Picture Park, set to launch their Music Video division in the new year.",Anonymous

8274,1742454,19,"Jean Acker was born in 1893 on a New Jersey farm and was named Harriet. Her father was part Cherokee and her mother was Irish. Her parents had separated when she was young. She attended school at St. Mary's Seminary in Springfield, New Jersey. Her acting career began in vaudeville and stock-company drama before she moved in front of the cameras.  In 1919, she came to California and negotiated a two-hundred-dollar-a-week contract with a movie studio based on the strength of her relationship with her lover, the famed star 'Alla Nazimova' (qv). Within a few months, she started another relationship with a younger, less established actress 'Grace Darmond' (qv). In the midst of this love triangle, she met the struggling actor 'Rudolph Valentino (I)' (qv) at a party, and they became friends. After a two-month courtship, he asked her to marry him and she accepted. On November 6, 1919, they married, and on their wedding night, she locked him out. She wept claiming she made a mistake and later departed to 'Grace Darmond' (qv)'s apartment. Valentino tried to reconcile with her, but to no avail, and the marriage ended in divorce two years later when Valentino was a major star, while Acker's career was waning.  Newspapers had a field day when Valentino was charged with bigamy as he hadn't waited long enough to marry his second wife, the talented set and costume designer, 'Natacha Rambova' (qv). Acker sued for the legal right to call herself \"Mrs. Rudolph Valentino,\" and Valentino remained angry at her for several years. However, they rekindled their friendship a few months before his death in 1926. She was one of the last people who saw him alive, and she attended his funeral with her mother. Soon after he died, she wrote and published a popular song about him, \"We Will Meet at the End of the Trail.\"  She played bit parts in films, usually uncredited, until the early 1950s. She and her companion Chloe Carter owned a Beverly Hills building where actress 'Patricia Neal (I)' (qv) lived for several years. She died in 1978 at the age of eighty-five.

The record company quickly became the number one independent record company in the United States, known for its incredibly unique and unclassifiable music. Throughout the late 80s, Windham Hill fell into a slew with other pseudo-\"New Age\" record companies, which in turn hurt the label. Although the label did incredibly well even through the 90s, Ackerman sold his interests to Sony/BMG music in 1992, claiming the company was too big for his interests. The record company continues to do well, though the artists who recorded during the \"Ackerman\" era subsequently left recording with the album in order to keep their music independent. Ackerman currently runs and produces a new independent record company: Imaginary Road Music and Imaginary Road Studios.",

Every day, actors face the financial challenge of living a freelance lifestyle, the disrespect of people who think they should get real jobs, and their own fear that they'll never work again. Every day, they have to ignore the possibility that the vision they have dedicated their lives to is a pipe dream. With every role, they stretch themselves, emotionally and physically, risking criticism and judgment. With every passing year, many of them watch as the other people their age achieve the predictable milestones of normal life - the car, the family, the house, the nest egg. Why? Because actors are willing to give their entire lives to a moment - to that line, that laugh, that gesture, or that interpretation that will stir the audience's soul. Actors are beings who have tasted life's nectar in that crystal moment when they poured out their creative spirit and touched another's heart. In that instant, they were as close to magic, God, and perfection as anyone could ever be. And in their own hearts, they know that to dedicate oneself to that moment is worth a thousand lifetimes.",

8784,6678,19,"Joss Ackland, the distinguished English actor who has appeared in over 100 movies, scores of plays and a plethora of television programs in his six-decade career, was born Sidney Edmond Jocelyn Ackland on February 29, 1928, in North Kensington, London. After attending London's Central School of Speech and Drama, the 17-year-old Ackland made his professional stage debut in \"The Hasty Heart\" in 1945.  Although he first appeared on film in 'John Boulting' (qv)'s and 'Roy Boulting' (qv)'s Oscar-winning thriller _Seven Days to Noon (1950)_ (qv) in an uncredited bit role, he made his credited debut in a supporting role in 'Vernon Sewell' (qv)'s _Ghost Ship (1952)_ (qv). He would not again grace the big screen until the end of the decade. Instead, Ackland spent the latter half of the 1940s and the first half of the 1950s honing his craft in regional theatrical companies.  In 1955 he left the English stage behind and moved to Africa to manage a tea plantation, an experience that likely informed his heralded performance 20 years later in _White Mischief (1987)_ (qv). In his two years in Africa he wrote plays and did service as a radio disc jockey. Upon his return to England in 1957, he joined the Old Vic company.  From 1962-64 he served as associate director of the Mermaid Theatre. Subsequently, his stage acting career primarily was in London's commercial West End theater, where he made a name for himself in musicals. He was distinguished as Captain Hook in the musical version of \"Peter Pan\" and as Juan Peron in \"Evita\". In the straight theater he was a memorable Falstaff in 'William Shakespeare (I)' (qv)'s \"Henry IV Parts 1 & 2\" and as Captain Shotover in 'George Bernard Shaw' (qv)'s \"Heartbreak House\". In the 1960s Ackland began appearing more regularly in films, and his career as a movie character actor picked up rapidly in the 1970s and began to flourish in the 1980s. It has shown little sign of abating in the 21st century, even though he's well into his 70s.  In addition to his performance in \"White Mischief\", among his more notable turns as an actor before the camera came in the BBC-TV production of _Shadowlands (1985) (TV)_ (qv), in which he played 'C.S. Lewis', and in _Lethal Weapon 2 (1989)_ (qv) as the South African heavy.  He is the father of seven children, whom he listed as his \"hobby\" in a 1981 interview. On December 31, 2000, Joss Ackland was named a Commander of the British Empire on the New Year's Honours List for his 50 years of service to the English stage, cinema and television.",Jon C. Hopwood

8935,6699,19,"Jensen Ross Ackles, or better known as just Jensen Ackles, was born on March 1, 1978, in Dallas, Texas, to actor 'Alan Ackles' (qv) and Donna Shaffer. He grew up in Richardson, Texas, together with his older brother, Joshua, and a younger sister, Mackenzie.  Jensen graduated from Dartmouth Elementary School in 1990, he graduated from Apollo Junior High School in 1993, and LV Berkner High School in 1996. Jensen, who is of Irish, British and German ancestry, is a sports junkie. He loves football, lacrosse, baseball and basketball. He even played on the baseball and lacrosse teams in high school.  The 6' 1\" actor first started modeling when he was just 2 years old. When he turned 4, he started appearing in TV commercials for Nabisco, RadioShack and Wal-Mart. He caught the acting bug because he was mostly influenced by his father, who was an actor in Dallas. He used to watch his father study scripts, and that taught him a few things about the industry. During his later years in high school, he started taking theater classes, where he claimed he was the only \"jock\" in that department.  When he was just a sophomore, a friend of Jensen had asked him to attend a local acting seminar. Two guys, Craig Wargo, and an agent, 'Michael Einfeld', were interested in Jensen's talent and wanted him to go to Los Angeles with them. Jensen had to say no to the offer and admitted at one point, he thought they would forget about him but, eventually, when he went to Los Angeles, he still managed to get help from them. Prior to that, Jensen actually planned to study sports medicine at Texas Tech University and become a physical therapist, before he decided to move to Los Angeles to give acting a try.  In 1996, he managed to secure guest roles on several TV shows, which included _\"Wishbone\" (1995)_ (qv), _\"Mr. Rhodes\" (1996)_ (qv), _\"7th Heaven\" (1996)_ (qv) and _\"Sweet Valley High\" (1994)_ (qv). Jensen's big break came when he was cast in the NBC soap opera, _\"Days of Our Lives\" (1965)_ (qv), as Eric Brady in 1997. He won a Soap Opera Digest Award for Best Male Newcomer in 1998, and was nominated three times in 1998, 1999, and 2000 for a Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Younger Actor in a Drama Series for his work on _\"Days of Our Lives\" (1965)_ (qv).  After spending about three years on a soap set, he left _\"Days of Our Lives\" (1965)_ (qv) and went on to appear in the mini-series _\"Blonde\" (2001)_ (qv), which was about the life of 'Marilyn Monroe' (qv), playing Eddie G. He also auditioned for the role of Clark Kent on _\"Smallville\" (2001)_ (qv), but lost the part to 'Tom Welling' (qv), instead.  Not giving up hope, he went for a few auditions and managed to secure a guest role on the popular 'James Cameron (I)' (qv) TV series, _\"Dark Angel\" (2000)_ (qv), as serial killer Ben/X5-493, the brother of main character Max/X5-452, who was played by 'Jessica Alba' (qv). His character died in the episode, but Jensen eventually returned to the show as a regular in the second season as Ben's clone, Alec/X5-494 and continued on until the show's cancellation in 2002.  In 2003, he joined the cast of _\"Dawson's Creek\" (1998)_ (qv), playing the role of C.J., Jen Lindley's lover. He also filmed episodes of the TV series, _\"Still Life\" (2003)_ (qv), playing the role of Max Morgan, not knowing that the series was actually dropped. He also had a small role in the short film, _The Plight of Clownana (2004)_ (qv), playing the role of Jensen.  That same year, he was offered the part of 'Eliza Dushku' (qv)'s love interest on the second season of _\"Tru Calling\" (2003)_ (qv). Jensen, however, turned down the role which was later offered to another actor, 'Eric Christian Olsen' (qv). He was subsequently cast on _\"Smallville\" (2001)_ (qv), as Assistant football coach Jason Teague, the new love interest of Lana Lang.  In 2005, Jensen managed to earn a lead role in the movie, _Devour (2005) (V)_ (qv), playing the role of Jake Gray. Jensen also earned the opportunity to work his father, actor 'Alan Ackles' (qv), who happened to play his character's father, Paul Kilton. The movie, however, received mixed reviews from the public.  That same year, Jensen joined the cast of the CW series, _\"Supernatural\" (2005)_ (qv), where he plays the role of Dean Winchester. Dean and his brother Sam, who is played by 'Jared Padalecki' (qv), are brothers who drive throughout the United States hunting paranormal predators, sometimes with their father, John Winchester, played by 'Jeffrey Dean Morgan' (qv). It was reported that the creator of the show, 'Eric Kripke' (qv), mentioned that the show will last for a maximum of five seasons.  In 2006, Jensen took on a role in the Independently filmed comedy/drama movie, _Ten Inch Hero (2007)_ (qv), which explores the theme of honesty and the flaw of judging by appearances. In 2007 the film began a limited run at number of film festivals including the Newport Beach Film Festival, Phoenix Film Festival and the Santa Cruz Film Festival but never made it into major mainstream theatrical release. In the Spring of 2008 Ten Inch Hero was released onto DVD exclusively through Blockbuster. Jensen however, received high praise for his work as Priestly, who one of the movie's more quirky characters.  From June 5-10 in 2007 Jensen had his professional stage debut as Lt. Daniel Kaffee in \"A Few Good Men\" at Casa Manana Theatre in Fort Worth, Texas, working along side 'Lou Diamond Phillips' (qv). This proved to be another successful acting venture for Jensen, as critics were impressed with his work in this role.  During his free time, Jensen enjoys golfing, horseback riding, scuba diving and photography. He is also a big fan of country music. His favorite musician is 'Garth Brooks (I)' (qv). He even sang back-up vocals on good friend 'Steve Carlson (VI)' (qv)'s albums \"Spot in the Corner\" and \"Rollin' On.\"  In the Summer of 2008 Jensen traveled to Kittaning, PA to film the horror/thriller movie, _My Bloody Valentine (2009)_ (qv), which was filmed in the cutting edge Real D technology, Jensen played the lead role of Tom Hanniger and starred alongside 'Jaime King (I)' (qv) and 'Kerr Smith' (qv). Jensen splits his off time between Burbank, California and Vancouver, British Columbia.",Anastasia Andrew Veno
